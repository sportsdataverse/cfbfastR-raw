href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4032646/terell-johnson\" target=\"_new\">Terell Johnson</a> for a 35-yard game-winning touchdown pass as St. Francis rallied past Lehigh 14-13 in Saturday's season opener.\n\nBrown's first two career touchdown passes came after halftime during his first start. Trailing 13-0 at the break, Brown threw a deep strike to his high school teammate EJ Jenkins for the Red Flash's first score late in the third quarter, and zipped the winner to Johnson with 1:17 left to play.\n\nBrown completed 22 of 37 passes for 293 yards. Jenkins led all receivers with 125 yards on five catches. He caught Brown's 75-yard TD pass over his left shoulder without breaking stride.\n\nLehigh mounted a serious bid to regain the lead in the final minute. Starting at their own 4, the Mountain Hawks drove 74 yards before <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4030592/austin-henning\" target=\"_new\">Austin Henning</a>'s potential game-winning 40-yard field goal sailed wide as time expired.\n\nHenning had earlier connected from 21 and 37 yards. Lehigh's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3912952/sam-mccloskey\" target=\"_new\">Sam McCloskey</a> scored the lone TD with a 56-yard fumble recovery.\n\nThe loss foiled the debut of coach Tom Gilmore, who would have been the 16th Lehigh coach to win his first game."},"videos":[{"source":"espn","id":27509316,"headline":"Lehigh crushes St. Francis punter, picks up loose
