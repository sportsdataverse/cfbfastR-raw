Coastal Carolina had seven third-down conversions to Gardner-Webb's four, and the Bulldogs' final drive of the game stalled in opposition territory to seal defeat.\n\nRyan Gates' 29-yard field goal put the Bulldogs ahead 3-0 to open the first, and MacDowall hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186369\">Marquel Willis</a> on touchdown passes of 3 and 2 yards to put the Chanticleers ahead 13-6 at the half.\n\nIn the third, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162458\">Devin Campbell</a> hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=178098\">Dobson Collins</a> on a 41-yard score to pull Gardner-Webb within one after a missed PAT.\n\nAfter MacDowall hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=168508\">Trent Usher</a> on a 39-yard score that gave the Chanticleers a 20-12 lead, Campbell and Collins connected on a 15-yard score to pull the Bulldogs within two points with nine minutes to play.
