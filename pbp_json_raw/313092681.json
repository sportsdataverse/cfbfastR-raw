each returned late interceptions for touchdowns, and Wagner snapped a seven-game losing streak in a 27-21 win over Sacred Heart on Saturday.\n\nStanford broke a 14-14 tie early in the fourth quarter when he picked off Sacred Heart quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/485223/tim-little\" target=\"_new\">Tim Little</a>'s pass, returning it for a 36-yard score for the Seahawks (2-7, 2-4 Northeast Conference). Wagner pushed its lead to 27-14 with 1:33 left in the game, thanks to Dieudonne's 66-yard interception that went for a score.\n\nThe Pioneers (5-4, 3-3) answered quickly with a five-play, 54-yard drive that was capped by Little's 35-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/478404/rock-tate\" target=\"_new\">Rock Tate</a>, cutting Wagner's lead to six points with 48 seconds left to play. But Sacred Heart was unable to recover an onside kick, preserving the victory for Wagner.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/485305/dominique-williams\"
