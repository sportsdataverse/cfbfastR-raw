Mercer responded with a 75-yard drive with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3117080/alex-lakes\" target=\"_new\">Alex Lakes</a> plunging in from the 1. However, the Bears' pass for the 2-point conversion was incomplete and The Citadel (6-2, 5-0) was able to run out the clock.\n\nThe Citadel is 5-0 in the Southern Conference for the first time, tied with Chattanooga.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/548337/cam-jackson\" target=\"_new\">Cam Jackson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/548343/tyler-renew\" target=\"_new\">Tyler Renew</a> both went over 100 yards rushing for the Bulldogs, who stayed on the ground for 367 yards against Mercer.
