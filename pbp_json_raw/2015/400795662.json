It was also Rhode Island's first win in the series since 2011.\n\nThe Rams intercepted Delaware (2-4, 1-2) quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/546390/joe-walker\" target=\"_new\">Joe Walker</a> three times, including <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3913276/tez-wilson\" target=\"_new\">Tez Wilson</a>'s 25-yard return for a touchdown, Rhode Island's first pick-six since 2013. Cooper's score came two plays after a pass interference penalty called on Delaware in the end zone. Cooper has back-to-back 100-yard games after rushing for 109 in a loss to Brown.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3913295/justin-rohrwasser\" target=\"_new\">Justin
