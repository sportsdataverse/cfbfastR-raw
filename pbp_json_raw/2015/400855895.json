Lauletta consistently burned the Redbirds with downfield passes, completing 18 of 30 attempts for 369 yards, and the Spiders defense held running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/533704/marshaun-coprich\" target=\"_new\">Marshaun Coprich</a>, the nation's second-leading rusher, to 30 yards on 14 carries -- although he scored on both a run and a reception.\n\nTrailing 32-14 midway through the fourth quarter, Illinois State scored two touchdowns to close within 32-27 with 3:23 left, but Green answered on Richmond's next drive with a clinching, 28-yard touchdown run at the 2:19 mark.\n\nGreen had clutch touchdowns all game. Richmond was nursing a 19-14 lead late in the third quarter when the senior turned a screen pass from Lauletta into a 35-yard score and 25-14 lead with 2:53 remaining in the third quarter.\n\nIllinois State had a touchdown pass nullified by a penalty on its next drive. On the ensuing play, Richmond linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/529929/omar-howard\" target=\"_new\">Omar Howard</a> intercepted Redbirds quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/513034/tre-roberson\" target=\"_new\">Tre Roberson</a> just outside the Spiders' end zone. They converted the turnover into Green's 27-yard touchdown run with 10 minutes left.\n\nGreen's first TD capped perhaps the game's pivotal possession late in the first half. Ahead 13-7, Richmond started a drive at its 13 with 2:08 left, but wasn't conservative as Lauletta completed five passes for 83 yards and set up Green for a 2-yard run, which provided a 19-7 lead just before halftime.\n\nLauletta was knocked briefly from the game during the Spiders' second possession of the game, but backup quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/529919/david-broadus\" target=\"_new\">David Broadus</a> finished off the drive with a 13-yard touchdown run, increasing their lead to 10-0 with 4:33 left in the first quarter.\n\nNot surprising, Lauletta attacked the Illinois State secondary with his favorite receivers. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/548662/brian-brown\" target=\"_new\">Brian Brown</a> caught five passes for 141 yards and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/529944/reggie-diggs\" target=\"_new\">Reggie Diggs</a> added five receptions for 80 yards. The Spiders finished with 556 offensive yards.\n\n\"Our playmakers stepped up and made plays when they needed to, (especially on) a couple of huge third-down conversions,\" Lauletta said. \"It was just one on one, giving (Brown and Diggs) a chance.\"\n\nRoberson passed for 370 yards, while <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/547505/anthony-warrum\" target=\"_new\">Anthony Warrum</a> had nine receptions for 152 yards and a touchdown.\n\nCoprich fell short in his bid for a second straight season with over 2,000 rushing yards. He finished with 1,967 yards this season."},"videos":[{"source":"espn","id":14345895,"headline":"K. Lauletta pass intercepted,S.
