href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/506379/kenny-james\" target=\"_new\">Kenny James</a> rushed for 122 yards and scored two touchdowns to lead San Diego to a share of the Pioneer League title with a 23-14 win over Jacksonville on Saturday.\n\nSan Diego (9-2, 7-1) tied idle Drake for the championship, winning its fourth league title and first since 2007.\n\nJames scored on a 1-yard run in the first quarter and took a pass 62 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter after the Dolphins (7-4, 6-2) cut the lead to 17-14.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/499653/kenslow-smith\" target=\"_new\">Kenslow Smith</a> added a 3-yard TD run and Mike Levine kicked a 24-yard field goal for the Toreros.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/388187/josh-mcgregor\" target=\"_new\">Josh McGregor</a>, the league's top-rated passer, was 22 of 36 for 214 yards for the Dolphins. But he threw an interception and lost two fumbles.\n\nMcGregor threw a 35-yard TD pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/499597/adrian-riley\" target=\"_new\">Adrian Riley</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/381063/jj-laster\" target=\"_new\">J.J. Laster</a> scored on a 1-yard scoring run for Jacksonville.\n\nJacksonville, which came in averaging 411 yards and 34 points per game, was held to 247 yards, 99 in the first half. The Toreros had seven sacks, 3 1/2 by Mario Kerns.\n\nMcGregor, the Pioneer League's career leader in passing yardage and touchdowns, also became its leader in completions. McGregor finished No. 6 on the all-time FCS list with 116 touchdown passes.\n\nMcGregor led a 10-play, 66-yard drive that ended with Laster's TD with 1:10 left in the third quarter to make the score 17-14.\n\nSan Diego used good field position to set up its first two touchdowns.\n\nAfter Ernie Collins' 62-yard punt pinned Jacksonville at its 2-yard line, the Dolphins had to punt from the 7. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/506377/sam-hoekstra\" target=\"_new\">Sam Hoekstra</a> took the kick at the Jacksonville 45-yard line and returned it to the 30.\n\nJames then carried on five of the next six plays, including a 1-yard TD late in the first quarter.\n\nEarly in the second quarter, McGregor was sacked and fumbled, and San Diego recovered at the Dolphins' 29-yard line. The Toreros started their drive at the 14 after Jacksonville coach Kerwin Bell was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct for arguing the fumble ruling.\n\nSmith scored four plays later for a 14-0 lead.\n\nThe Dolphins then put together their only productive drive of the first half by going 68 yards, with McGregor throwing the TD pass to Riley.\n\nLevine added a 24-yard field goal with 27 seconds left in the half."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
