His two passing touchdowns moved him within three scores of breaking Furman's single season record.\n\nAppalachian State (6-3, 5-2) outgained Furman 399-365 and held possession for 36:15 compared to just 23:45 for Furman. But penalties and turnovers marred the Mountaineers' offense.\n\nAppalachian State committed seven penalties, lost two fumbles, and Jamel Jackson threw interceptions on the Mountaineers' first two
