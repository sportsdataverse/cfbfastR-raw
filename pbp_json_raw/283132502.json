href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190264\">Chase Reynolds</a> rushed for 160 yards and three touchdowns to lead No. 5 Montana to a 29-12 victory over Portland State in Big Sky Conference action on Saturday.\n\nThe Grizzlies (9-1, 5-1 Big Sky) now must beat Idaho State next Saturday and Montana State the following week to ensure another trip to the national playoffs.\n\nPortland State (3-6, 2-4) managed to stay close for nearly three quarters, but the visiting Grizzlies proved to be more than the Vikings could handle down the stretch.\n\nPortland State closed Montana's lead to 16-12 when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188115\">Raymond Fry</a> caught a 38-yard touchdown pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234074\">Drew Hubel</a> midway through the third period.\n\nOn its next possession, Montana appeared ready to settle for a field goal.\n\nInstead, the Grizzlies pitched the ball back to kicker Brody McKnight and he rambled 13 yards around left end for a first down. Four plays later, on another fourth-down play, Reynolds broke a run up the middle for an 11-yard touchdown and a 23-12 lead for Montana.\n\nPortland State seemed to be on the verge of getting that touchdown back, but Montana regained possession when linebacker Brandon Fisher intercepted Hubel's pass near the goal line.\n\nThe Grizzlies couldn't take advantage, and were forced to punt the ball away. It hardly mattered, as Hubel was intercepted by Fisher again on the next play.\n\nTwo minutes later, Montana was on the board again when Reynolds bolted up the middle for a 20-yard touchdown, which pushed the Grizzlies' lead to 29-12 with 3:51 left to play.\n\nPortland State still had one more chance and moved the ball effectively behind third-string quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=235278\">Jimmy Collins</a>. But the Vikings wound up turning the ball over on downs after advancing inside the Grizzlies' 10.\n\nThrowing mostly short passes, Bergquist finished the day 16 of 23 for 118 yards. He also ran 16 times for 91 yards. Hubel led Portland State with 9 of 21 passing for 172 yards, but he also threw three interceptions."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
