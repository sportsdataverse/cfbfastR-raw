Bowen was gang-tackled at the eight as time ran out but the ball squirted out and Burdette snapped it up, racing untouched into the end zone while the Bulldogs celebrated.\n\nThe Bulldogs (3-2, 2-1) pulled off a stunner of their own less than a minute earlier.

He had three straight completions, with Bowen covering 13 and Burdette 17.\n\nMcGovern finished 29 of 44 for 271 yards. Burdette had an earlier touchdown and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3912092/donald-parham\" target=\"_new\">Donald Parham</a> had 12 catches for 112 yards and a touchdown.
