href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4247805/tucker-rovig\" target=\"_new\">Tucker Rovig</a> threw for 310 yards and three touchdowns to lead Montana State to 47-24 win over Wagner on Saturday.\n\nMSU (2-1) weathered a game-opening 98-yard kickoff return by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3131165/denzel-knight\" target=\"_new\">Denzel Knight</a>, who also had a 48-yard return later in the first quarter. Wagner (1-2) scored after both returns, but the Bobcats scored 30 first-half points to keep the Seahawks at bay.\n\nRovig hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4047518/kevin-kassis\" target=\"_new\">Kevin Kassis</a> for two scores and true freshman <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4365621/isaiah-ifanse\" target=\"_new\">Isaiah Ifanse</a> for another. Ifanse finished with 146 yards rushing, including a 73-yard touchdown, and 72 yards receiving. Kassis had nine catches for 126 yards.\n\n\"He takes chances and throws the ball downfield and that helps our running game,\" Kassis said of Roving, who was starting his second game after starter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4247807/troy-andersen\" target=\"_new\">Troy Andersen</a> went down with a broken bone in his hand.\n\nAndersen still made his presence felt as he galloped 57 yards for a touchdown for MSU's final score.  MSU gained 556 yards, which is its first 500-yard game since 2015.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4250279/ryan-fulse\" target=\"_new\">Ryan Fulse</a> paced the Seahawks with 181 yards rushing on 25 carries with two touchdowns. He also had a team-best 70 yards receiving on five catches.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3913111/santoni-graham\" target=\"_new\">Santoni Graham</a> led Wagner with eight tackles, while <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3910442/walker-cozzie\" target=\"_new\">Walker Cozzie</a> led MSU with 9.5.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nMontana State travels to
