single-season record with its fifth shutout on the season. South Carolina State accomplished the same feat in 1978.\n\nColgate, which has outscored its opponents 168-3 in the first half of all games this season, has allowed just one touchdown on defense in its last 47 quarters, dating back to Oct. 21, 2017.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4247540/grant-breneman\" target=\"_new\">Grant Breneman</a> was 16-of-19 passing for 198 yards with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3909299/owen-rockett\" target=\"_new\">Owen Rockett</a> hauling in four for 93 yards.\n\nThe Raiders had 562 yards of offense while limiting Fordham to just 28 yards. Colgate ran for 364 yards while holding the Rams (1-8, 1-3) to a minus-50 yards on the ground, the result of its six sacks of Fordham freshman quarterback <a
