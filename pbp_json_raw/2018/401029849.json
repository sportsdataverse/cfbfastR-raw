touchdown to open the scoring and both ran for a touchdown in the third quarter. Castillo put an exclamation mark on the Raiders' third shutout of the season when he took his 11th career interception 58 yards to cap the scoring with 2:55 to play.\n\nColgate (6-0), trails in the series 49-48-4 but has won 9 of 10 and 19 of 22. The 6-0 start is the best since 2009 and 11 straight wins dating to last year is the best since the 2003 team won 15 straight.\n\nBreneman finished 16 of 25 for 206 yards and Holland ran for 119 yards on 16 carries and added 33 yards on five receptions. The defense limited the Big Red (2-3) to 252 yards, forcing three turnovers, one interception from each of the three Cornell players to attempt a pass.\n\nColgate has gone five games without allowing a touchdown and have outscored opponents 46-0 in the first quarter and 113-3 in the first half."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
