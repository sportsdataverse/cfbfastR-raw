Eastern Washington (5-1, 4-0) then took advantage of a roughing the kicker penalty, driving 84 yards and scoring on a 33-yard pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/511713/vernon-adams\" target=\"_new\">Vernon Adams</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/511723/quincy-forte\" target=\"_new\">Quincy Forte</a> to go up 13-10.\n\nMcGhee connected on 12 of 15 passes for 141 yards in the first half, including a 2-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/498119/lee-perkins\" target=\"_new\">Lee Perkins</a> to put Montana State up 7-0.

McGhee finished 28 of 36 for 294 yards, while Adams was just 12 of 29 for 140 yards.  Both were intercepted twice.\n\n\"When you have the things that happened to us, especially in the fourth quarter, it's tough to re-group that late,\" Montana State coach Rob Ash
