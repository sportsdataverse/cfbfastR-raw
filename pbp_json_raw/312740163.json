opener for both teams.\n\nColumbia (0-3) drew first blood when A.J. Maddox returned a Wornham interception 9 yards for a touchdown to take a 7-3 lead. But on Princeton's next possession, Wornham capped off a seven-play, 62-yard drive with a 5-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=483797\" target=\"_new\">Mark Hayes</a> that gave the Tigers a 10-7 lead they never relinquished.\n\nColumbia pulled within three points when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=483617\" target=\"_new\">Sean Brackett</a> hooked up with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=240964\" target=\"_new\">Paul Havas</a> on a 28-yard pass but Wornham connected with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=483811\" target=\"_new\">Tom Moak</a> on a 12-yard pass to give Princeton a 24-14 lead late in the third quarter.\n\nWornham finished with 194 yards and two touchdowns on 19-for-28 passing and added 68 rushing yards.\n\nThe win snaps a Princeton program-record 10-game losing streak, which began last season with a 42-14 loss at Columbia."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
