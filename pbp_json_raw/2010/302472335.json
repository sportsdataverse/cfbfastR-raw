href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=487369\" target=\"_new\">Kyle Harbridge</a> of the Red Flash, Liberty (1-0) went on to score 52 unanswered points while racking up 599 yards of offense.\n\nThe Flames offense was led by junior quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186975\" target=\"_new\">Mike Brown</a>, who threw for 338 yards and four touchdowns -- the first of which came with 5:08 left in the second quarter on a 75-yard strike to wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486999\" target=\"_new\">Pat Kelly</a>. That gave Liberty its first lead of the game at 10-3.\n\nLiberty scored 24 points in the second quarter as the Flames entered halftime with a commanding 24-7 lead.\n\nWide receivers Kelly, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=242039\" target=\"_new\">Chris Summers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=240971\" target=\"_new\">B.J.
