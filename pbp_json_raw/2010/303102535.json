href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234576\" target=\"_new\">Mitch Allen</a> scored on a 5-yard run to complete a 98-yard scoring drive Saturday, giving Wofford a 10-3 win over Samford.\n\nThe 12-play drive consumed 6:08 of the third and fourth quarters for the Terriers (8-1, 6-0 Southern Conference). <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=380548\" target=\"_new\">Eric Breitenstein</a>, Wofford's leading rusher with 227 yards on 28 carries, ran five times for 28 yards on the drive.\n\nThe Terriers never had a third down during the possession, which started when Bob Hooper's 54-yard punt was downed at the Wofford 2. Allen rushed for four first downs and passed to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234595\" target=\"_new\">Mike Rucker</a> for another on the drive.\n\nWofford gained 360 of its 386 yards of total offense on the ground.\n\nWofford's Christian Reed kicked a 32-yard field goal in the third quarter to tie the game 3-3. Samford (4-5, 2-4) led 3-0 after Cameron Yaw's 36-yard field goal with 50 seconds left in the first half."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
