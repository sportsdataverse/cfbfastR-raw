Furman.\n\nShaw scored on 3-, 1- and 4-yard runs as the Eagles (7-4, 5-3 Southern Conference) won on the road for the sixth time in the series. Furman (5-6, 3-5), finished with its first losing season since 1998.\n\nShaw's final touchdown with 1:07 left capped a 15-point fourth quarter that brought the Eagles back from a 28-17 deficit. The Eagles trailed 14-0 in the first quarter and never led until Shaw's 4-yard score.\n\nThe game was the last for Furman coach Bobby Lamb, who announced this week that he would resign after the season, the fourth straight in which Furman missed the Football Championship Subdivision playoffs.\n\nLamb, a former Furman quarterback who became an assistant coach in 1986 and was promoted in 2001,
