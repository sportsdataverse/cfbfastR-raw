The Eagles, who kept possession for 41:40, will play at No. 2 seed William & Mary on Dec. 4.\n\nAt times, the Bulldogs (9-3), who lost in the first round for the third straight year, were their own worst enemy. The Eagles scored two safeties off mishandled kickoffs and returned a fumble for a touchdown.\n\nThe Eagles were leading 9-0 with 6:10 left in the first quarter when Shaw left the game with an apparent concussion. He watched the rest of the game from the sidelines with his pads removed.\n\nGeorgia Southern coach Jeff Monken said after the game he hadn't talked to the medical staff about Shaw's status.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=505844\" target=\"_new\">Jerick McKinnon</a> replaced Shaw, and after a shaky start he settled down to guide the Eagles to 22 second-half points.\n\nFreshman fullback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=505806\" target=\"_new\">Robert Brown</a> led Georgia Southern with 77 yards rushing on 15 carries. Brown, however, also had three fumbles and was replaced in the fourth quarter by seldom-used senior <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=477598\" target=\"_new\">Lee Banks</a>, who rushed eight times for 56 yards.\n\nGeorgia Southern led 16-0 after the first quarter thanks to a 5-yard run by J.J. Wilcox, a safety and a 34-yard run with a fumble by Josh Gebhardt.\n\nWilcox, a wide receiver, had 50 yards rushing and he also had a 1-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Third-team quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486498\" target=\"_new\">Russell DeMasi</a>, playing in his first game of the season, made it 41-10 with 6 minutes to play on a 1-yard run.\n\nGeorgia Southern made it 19-0 on a 32-yard field goal by Adrian Mora 3 minutes into the second quarter.\n\nThe Bulldogs got a 90-yard kickoff return by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=476660\" target=\"_new\">Lennel Elmore</a> and a 21-yard field goal by Blake Erickson to make it 19-10 at the half.
