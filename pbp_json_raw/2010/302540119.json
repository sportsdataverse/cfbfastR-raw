overtime as Towson beats Coastal Carolina 47-45 on Saturday night.\n\nCoastal Carolina running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=239671\" target=\"_new\">Eric O'Neal</a> scored on a 5-yard run and the Chanticleers tried to send the game into a sixth overtime, but <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=183454\" target=\"_new\">Zach MacDowall</a>'s pass was deflected by Dangerfield.\n\nThe Tigers (1-1) trailed 21-7 in the fourth quarter before rallying to tie the game on two touchdown passes by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=505725\" target=\"_new\">Chris Hart</a>.\n\nHart found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=483012\" target=\"_new\">James Oboh</a> for a 2-yard score with 9:40 left in regulation, and then connected on another 2-yard TD to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=484694\" target=\"_new\">Tom Ryan</a> with 3:54 left.\n\nHart finished 13 of 21 for 155 yards and rushed for 79 more on 22 carries. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=479072\" target=\"_new\">Tremayne Dameron</a> added 107 yards on 29 carries for the Tigers.\n\nBoth teams traded field goals in the first overtime, before MacDowall scored on a 1-yard rush to put Coastal Carolina (0-2) up 30-24 in the second extra period. Justin Durham's extra point missed wide left.\n\nDameron tied the game on a 2-yard run, but Towson kicker Nick Wallace hit the left upright with a chance to win it -- sending the game into a third overtime.\n\nThe Tigers then took a 36-30 lead on Dameron's 4-yard run, but Hart's two-point conversion failed.\n\nAfter O'Neal scored from 7 yards out, the Chanticleers once again couldn't win it as MacDowall's pass attempt failed.\n\nBoth team's kickers converted field goals in the fourth overtime period, and Hart went to work quickly in the fifth.\n\nHart found Moore for a 25-yard touchdown to lead 47-39.\n\nBoth kickers converted a field goal in the fourth overtime period, sending the game to another overtime period.\n\nThe Tigers' possession in the fifth overtime period was short as Hart hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=194474\" target=\"_new\">Hakeem Moore</a> for a 25-yard TD pass.
