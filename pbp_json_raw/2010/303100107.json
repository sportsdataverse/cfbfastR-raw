href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=478684\" target=\"_new\">Chris Lum</a> threw for 212 yards and three touchdowns and ran for another 64 yards as Lehigh defeated Holy Cross 34-17 on Saturday for its fifth straight win.\n\nThe victory, coupled with Colgate's win over Lafayette, gave the Mountain Hawks (7-2, 3-0) at least a share of the Patriot League championship. Lehigh can win the title outright if it beats Georgetown next Saturday.\n\nLum, who completed 21 of 33 passes, found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=380738\" target=\"_new\">Jake Drwal</a> for a 30-yard score with 11:35 left in the third quarter to make it 21-3.\n\nIn the first half, Lum threw for touchdowns of 21 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=242359\" target=\"_new\">Craig Zurn</a> for the game's opening score and 5 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=242313\" target=\"_new\">Alex Wojdowski</a>, who broke a tackle to score on the final play of the first half.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=484470\" target=\"_new\">Gerald Mistretta</a>'s 2-yard scoring run on his only carry of the game gave the Crusaders (4-5, 1-2) their first
