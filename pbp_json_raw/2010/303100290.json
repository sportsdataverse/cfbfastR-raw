snapping the Mountaineers' 26-game winning streak in Southern Conference play.\n\nThe loss was Appalachian State's first in a conference game since losing to Georgia Southern, 38-35, on Oct. 20, 2007.\n\nThe Eagles (5-4, 3-3) overcame an early 14-0 deficit, but scored the game's final 21 points to pull off the upset. The Mountaineers (8-1, 6-1) had three turnovers, all in the red zone, including a fumble by quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=381870\" target=\"_new\">DeAndre Presley</a> on the final play of the game.\n\nShaw, hobbled by a hip injury, rushed for 86 yards and a 16-yard run to convert a third down in overtime before Brown scored the game-deciding touchdown for Georgia Southern.\n\nOn the next possession, Presley fumbled and Josh Rowe recovered the loose ball to seal the win for Georgia Southern."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Sun Belt -
