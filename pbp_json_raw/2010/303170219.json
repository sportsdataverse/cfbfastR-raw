The Quakers ended two of those drives with interceptions and also stopped Harvard on downs with 56 seconds left.\n\nColavita scored on a 2-yard run 3:15 before halftime, and his 35-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter gave Penn its final points.\n\nHarvard's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233508\" target=\"_new\">Gino Gordon</a> carried 21 times for 110 yards and a
