67 yards on 25 carries against the Hoyas.\n\nThe Hoyas' defense, led by Robert McCabe with 14 tackles, prevented Wagner from sustaining drives, as the Seahawks converted just 3 of 18 third downs.\n\nWhile the Seahawks' offense was struggling, Georgetown's was relying on Kempf, who finished with 183 yards and a touchdown on 12-of-24 passing and 35 yards rushing on 11
