with eight seconds left in the game to give Lafayette an 8-7 victory over Penn on Saturday night.\n\nLafayette, which held Penn (1-0) to just 224 yards, has its first 3-0 start since 1988.\n\nThe Quakers, faced with a fourth-and-10 from their own 1-yard line with 5:15 left to play, took an intentional safety. The Leopards took the ensuing punt from the Penn 30-yard line, and with quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159046\">Mike DiPaola</a> and halfback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173066\">Maurice White</a> running the ball, moved to the Penn 10-yard line before Rodriguez made his game-winner.\n\nPenn took a 7-0 lead on a 1-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=155577\">Joe Sandberg</a> with 8:30 left in the first quarter. A 21-yard field goal by Rodriguez made it 7-3 with 14:41 left in the half.\n\nFour turnovers by each team then kept the game scoreless until the final minutes.\n\nWhite gained 161 yards on 28 carries. Penn's leading runner, Sandberg, who had more than 1,000 yards last season, gained 85 yards on 17 carries in the first half, but a leg injury kept him out of the entire second half.\n\nThe victory was Lafayette's first over Penn in seven tries dating back to 1991. Penn, which was opening its 131st football season, now leads the overall series 8-3."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
