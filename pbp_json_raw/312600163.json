Princeton 34-22 on Saturday night.\n\nLum's first three scoring passes went to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486380\" target=\"_new\">Ryan Spadola</a>, who had nine receptions for 214 yards. Lum's fourth TD, a 2-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=502361\" target=\"_new\">Sean Farrell</a>, gave the Mountain Hawks (2-1) a 27-9 lead with 11:11 remaining.\n\nIvan Charbonneau returned the ensuing kickoff 92 yards for the Tigers (0-1), who then recovered an onside kick and cut Lehigh's lead to 27-22 with a 26-yard pass from <a

with 1:54 left.\n\nPrinceton then drove to the Lehigh 10 but lost the ball on downs with 20 seconds remaining.\n\nLum, who came in as the Football Championship Subdivision's No. 3 passer, completed 28 of 38 with no interceptions."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
