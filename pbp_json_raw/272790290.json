(AP) -- Jesse Hartley kicked a 54-yard field goal on the final play of the game to give Georgia Southern a 41-38 victory over South Dakota State on Saturday.\n\nHartley's game winning kick, a career long, was set up by an interception by Carson Hill with 21 seconds remaining. The Jackrabbits got the ball back with 31 seconds to play and the score tied but chose not to sit on it.\n\nSouth Dakota State quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159001\">Ryan Berry</a> threw for 335 yards, 203 in the second half when he led his team back from a 31-7 halftime deficit. However, he went to the well once to often against Hill who had trouble defending <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159009\">JaRon Harris</a>. Hill intercepted the ball at the Georgia Southern 46 and two plays gained 17 yards before Hartley kicked the game-winner.\n\nSouth Dakota State kicker Parker Douglass, who had made all 12 of his field goal attempts this season, missed a 37-yard attempt with 2:43 to play.\n\nGeorgia Southern took a quick 14-0 lead, driving 94 yards on its first possession. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=166665\">Lamar Lewis</a> scored on a one-yard run to end the 13-play drive. Less than two minutes later defensive back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173426\">Chris Rogers</a> picked up a fumble and ran it back 46 yards.\n\nAfter Harris caught a 30-yard touchdown pass early in the first period Eagle defensive end Larry Beard duplicated Rogers feat when he ran 29 yards with a fumble.\n\nAfter Georgia Southern got a field goal the generous Jackrabbits fumbled the ball away again with 1:10 on the clock and Jayson Foser teamed with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=146127\">Irving Campbell</a> on a 7-yard touchdown pass to make it 31-7 at the half.\n\nThe Jackrabbits then scored 17 unanswered third quarter points to get back in the game. One of the scores was a 71 yard interception return by Tyler Koch. After Foster scored on a 14-yard run the Jackrabbits scored twice to tie the game. Foster finished with 92 yards rushing and completed 23 of 31 passes for 225 yards."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
