href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3912073/matt-taft\" target=\"_new\">Matt Taft</a> scored from four-yards out in the fourth quarter as Stetson pulled out a 19-14 victory over Marist in the Pioneer Football League opener for both schools Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe win is just the second time the Hatters have beaten Marist in six meetings and the first since 2014. The team's 3-0 start is a first in the modern era of Stetson football, which returned in 2013, and matches the 3-0 start the Hatters made in 1951.\n\nComing back from an unexpected bye week after their game at Presbyterian was cancelled by Hurricane Florence, the Hatters (3-0, 1-0) took a 13-0 lead in the second quarter, but the redshirt freshman <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4368218/mike-husni\" target=\"_new\">Mike Husni</a> fired a pair of touchdown passes to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3928049/jon-kanda\" target=\"_new\">Jon Kanda</a> to put the Red Foxes (0-3, 0-1) up, 14-13.\n\nThe Marist pair hooked up from 14-yards out with :02 left in the half to make it 13-7, then connected from 26-yards out in the fourth quarter to take the lead.\n\nStetson answered by marching 75 yards in 10 plays to retake the lead, with Taft carrying three straight times to cap the drive.\n\n------------\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and
