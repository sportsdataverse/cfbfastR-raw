The Wildcat defense held Maine to 2 yards and forced three incomplete passes in OT to seal the victory.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=175913\">Jhamal Fluellen</a> rushed for 170 yards and two scores, including a 50-yard dash with 7:19 left in the fourth quarter that gave Maine (1-2, 0-1) a 17-10 lead. Dicken hauled in a 67-yard touchdown pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172065\">Antwon Young</a> on the next possession to tie the game with 6:17 left in regulation.\n\nThe Black Bears had a chance to win in the closing seconds of the fourth quarter but Devin McNeill's 28-yard field goal attempt went wide right.\n\nDicken finished with 112 yards on 25 carries and caught three passes for 72 yards. Young threw for 178 yards and a 23-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=149539\">Anton Ridley</a> in the second quarter that made it 7-7 at halftime.\n\nJoe Marcoux kicked a 28-yard field goal in the third quarter to give the Wildcats a 10-7 lead. McNeill tied the game early in the fourth with a 26-yarder of his own.\n\nVillanova held Maine to just 66 yards on 11-for-26 passing and outgained the Black Bears 320 yards to
