a 40-0 rout of Central State (Ohio) Saturday.\n\nThe Governors (3-6) dominated Central State (1-9) in every facet of the game. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/234423/ryan-white\" target=\"_new\">Ryan White</a> rushed for 146 yards for Austin Peay, which totaled 407 yards on the ground on 57 carries.\n\nCentral State, meanwhile, managed just 86 yards in 33 rushing attempts.\n\nWhite ran for two touchdowns, the first a 26-yarder to open the scoring in the first quarter. Stephen Stansell kicked two field goals for the Governors.\n\nLeading by 13-0 at halftime, Austin Peay broke it open after the break. The Governors scored two touchdowns apiece in the third and fourth quarters while completely shutting down Central State's overmatched offense. When Tee Howell returned a punt for a 65-yard touchdown early in the third quarter, Austin Peay was up 20-0. The Governors never looked back."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
