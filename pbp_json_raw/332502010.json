them to a single touchdown in the third quarter. Nared connected on a 56-yard pass to Marquel Gardner at the start of the fourth quarter to seal the win in Tuskegee's season opener.\n\nThe Golden Tigers defense kept the Alabama A&M off-balance all night, recovering two fumbles and limiting them to a single score.\n\nTuskegee lost a 7-6 nail biter to Alabama A&M last year, giving them its only regular-season loss.
