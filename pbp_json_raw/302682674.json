and a 13-yard interception return by defensive tackle David Witkiewicz.\n\nThe Crusaders (0-4) rallied with two touchdowns sandwiched around a fumble by Seeger in the fourth quarter, but a missed PAT in the first quarter and a failed 2-point conversion on their second touchdown were the difference in the game.\n\nNeither team showed much offense.
