Elon 34-31 on Saturday to remain undefeated.\n\nPresley was 14-for-19 for 204 yards for the Mountaineers (5-0, 3-0 Southern Conference), who won their 23rd straight league game and 15th in a row over the Phoenix (2-4, 1-2) before a record crowd of 31,531.\n\nPresley's career-long 53-yard scoring run put Appalachian State ahead 20-10 with 2:37 to go in the second quarter. <a

43-yard TD pass to Mellette for 27-24.\n\nPresley widened the lead early in the fourth with a 13-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190019\" target=\"_new\">CoCo
