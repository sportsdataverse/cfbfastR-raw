rival Sacred Heart 12-3 Saturday.\n\nWagner (3-3, 3-1) scored the game's first points when Williams broke down the sideline for an 81-yard touchdown run.\n\nThe Seahawks padded their lead early in the second quarter when Williams ran it in from 2 yards out on fourth-and-goal. Wagner led 12-0 at the half.\n\nSacred Heart (1-4, 1-2) got on the board with 2:15 left in the third quarter with a 20-yard field goal by <a
