record for points with a 62-13 win over Alabama State on Saturday night.\n\nThe Owls (2-1), ranked eighth in the coaches poll, offered free tickets to North Carolina and South Carolina evacuees from Hurricane Florence but those fans had to endure a one-hour and 42-minute delay to the start of the game because of lightning.\n\nThe 62 points against the Hornets (1-2) surpassed the 58 scored against Edward Waters in 2015.\n\nAll of Burks' offensive production came in the first half when the Owls took a 42-6 lead. He completed all four of his passes for 95 yards and finished with 70 of the Owls' 417 rushing yards. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3911993/darnell-holland\" target=\"_new\">Darnell Holland</a> rushed for 136 yards, including a 70-yard touchdown, also all in the first half.\n\nKennesaw State's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4246731/isaac-foster\" target=\"_new\">Isaac Foster</a> opened the second half with a program-record 100-yard kickoff return.\n\nThe Owls
