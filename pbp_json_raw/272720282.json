(AP) -- Four turnovers in the first half helped send Southern Illinois to a 72-10 blowout of Indiana State on Saturday, the Sycamores' first game since coach Lou West was fired.\n\nThe Salukis (5-0, 1-0) scored seven rushing touchdowns and returned an interception for another score as they set a Gateway Conference record for most points scored in a league game.\n\nSouthern Illinois opened the game with three rushing touchdowns in the first quarter. The Salukis then used an interception return, two more touchdown runs and two touchdown passes from quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160935\">Nick Hill</a> to build a 55-10 halftime lead.\n\nThe Salukis ran for 321 yards on 58 carries, intercepted four passes and recovered an Indiana State fumble.\n\nIndiana State (0-5, 0-1) scored its lone touchdown on a 44-yard run by Alex Thomas in the second quarter.\n\nThe Sycamores fired West Sept. 24 after the team went 1-25 since he became coach in 2005. The school then hired former Sycamores coach Dennis Raetz as an interim replacement. He won 94 games in 18 years with the Sycamores before leaving in 1997."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
