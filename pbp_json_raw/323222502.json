The multidimensional quarterback completed 26-of-38 passes for 381 yards and two more touchdowns, adding his total to four for Eastern Washington (9-2, 7-1 Big Sky).\n\nPortland State (3-8, 2-6) took a 26-14 lead with 6:23 to go in the third quarter when D.J. Adams scored on a 4-yard touchdown run, his third of the night, but the Eagles answered with three straight scoring drives including Padron's 18-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/484586/nicholas-edwards\" target=\"_new\">Nicholas Edwards</a>. Edwards and four catches for 77 yards and two scores.\n\nThe Vikings took a 13-0 lead when Adams scored two touchdowns in the first quarter but were outscored 41-21 the rest of the way.\n\nEastern Washington earns the Big Sky's automatic bid to the NCAA playoffs with the victory. The Eagles and Montana State were tied atop the conference at 7-1 after Montana State beat Montana 16-7 and with Cal Poly earning a road victory at Northern Arizona, 42-34, there is a three-way tie for the title. Eastern Washington earns the automatic bid thanks to its 27-24 win at Montana State on Oct. 13, the deciding factor in the tiebreakers."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
