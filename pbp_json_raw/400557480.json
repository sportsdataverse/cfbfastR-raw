href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/511469/malcolm-agnew\" target=\"_new\">Malcolm Agnew</a> ran for three touchdowns, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/512983/mark-iannotti\" target=\"_new\">Mark Iannotti</a> threw for another and Southern Illinois scored 31 straight points on its way to a 41-10 win over South Dakota on Saturday night.\n\nAgnew had 128 yards on 26 carries for the Salukis (5-1, 2-0 Missouri Valley Conference). Iannotti finished with 19-of-32 passing for 264 yards. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/548358/thomas-kinney\" target=\"_new\">Thomas Kinney</a> kicked two field goals.\n\nAgnew's first score came on an 11-yard run -- following <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/548372/tay-willis\" target=\"_new\">Tay Willis</a>' 75-yard kickoff return -- for a 7-3 Southern Illinois lead.\n\nSouth Dakota tied the game 10-10 on a 5-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/530154/jasper-sanders\" target=\"_new\">Jasper Sanders</a> with a minute to play in the first half.\n\nBut in the second half it was all Southern Illinois, starting with a Kinney field goal, followed by Iannotti's 32-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/499085/mycole-pruitt\" target=\"_new\">MyCole Pruitt</a> and two rushing TDs by Agnew early in the fourth. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/548370/cameron-walter\" target=\"_new\">Cameron Walter</a> scored again for the Salukis with 7:14 to play.\n\nSouthern Illinois has outscored its six opponents 114-13 in the second half this season. Only Purdue has been able to hold the Salukis to less than 34 points.\n\n\"They're billed as a second-half team. I'm believing it,\" South Dakota coach Joe Glenn said. \"They just outplayed us. We got beat in every phase. They did the same things they did in first half, they just did it better.\"\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/537987/ryan-saeger\" target=\"_new\">Ryan Saeger</a> threw 13 of 27 for 191 yards for the Coyotes (2-3, 0-1).\n\nGlenn said starting quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/513823/kevin-earl\" target=\"_new\">Kevin Earl</a> is expected to return from injury next week.\n\n\"We just can't miss and we started the second half missing passes,\" Glenn said. \"To get momentum you've got to make some big plays. We just didn't get it done in the second half.\"\n\nSanders ran 12 times for 44 yards for USD and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/537789/trevor-bouma\" target=\"_new\">Trevor Bouma</a> had 60 yards on 14 carries.\n\nThe Salukis rolled up 506 yards of total offense, including 242 on the ground.\n\n\"I don't know what happened,\" Glenn said. \"We'll see. We just weren't the same team.\"\n\nUSD has not won a conference opener since joining the MVFC in 2012."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
