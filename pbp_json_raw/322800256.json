href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/478957/justin-thorpe\" target=\"_new\">Justin Thorpe</a>'s 9-yard touchdown run with 1:24 to play vaulted James Madison to a 13-10 win over Towson in Colonial Athletic Association action Saturday.\n\nThorpe's game-winner capped a riveting fourth quarter, which began when Towson (2-3, 1-1) quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/519428/grant-enders\" target=\"_new\">Grant Enders</a> orchestrated a 14-play, 92-yard scoring drive. Enders was 6-of-6 passing for 61 yards on the drive, and ran in a go-ahead, 7-yard touchdown with 3:21 left.\n\nThe Dukes (4-1, 2-0) began the ensuing drive at their own 21, and drove 79 yards in eight plays before Thorpe ran in what proved the game-winner. Thorpe was 6-of-6 passing for 60 yards on the drive, and finished the game 11 of 19 for 116 yards.\n\nThorpe, in his fifth year in the program, was granted a sixth season of eligibility by the NCAA earlier this week after missing 2008 and 2010 with injuries.\n\nTowson's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/516385/terrance-west\" target=\"_new\">Terrance West</a> ran 28
