round of the FCS playoffs on Saturday.\n\nVirgil finished with a career-high 474 yards passing and three TD passes for the Lions (8-4), who visit No. 6 seed Montana in the second round next Saturday.\n\nSE Louisiana erased a 31-14 halftime deficit with 17 straight points in the third quarter. The Wildcats (9-4) answered with leads of 38-31 and 44-38 in the fourth quarter, failing to convert the PAT on the second touchdown with 4:36 left in the game.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4429760/jaaron-hayek\" target=\"_new\">Jaaron Hayek</a> caught a 40-yard TD pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4029805/daniel-smith\" target=\"_new\">Daniel Smith</a> that would have given the lead back to Villanova with 1:31 left, but Hayek was called for pass interference. That gave Villanova a first-and-25 from the Wildcats 45. Villanova turned it over on downs and SE Louisiana ran out the clock.\n\nTurner caught 11 passes for 173 yards and two touchdowns. <a
