(Pennsylvania) 38-31 on Saturday.\n\nThe Blue Devils (9-1, 5-0 Northeast Conference) are ranked No. 20 in the STATS FCS 25, but had to scramble for the win.\n\nThe Red Flash (4-6, 2-4) outgained CCSU 434-367 in total offense, ran a dozen more plays, and led 31-28 lead with a little more than four minutes left in the game.\n\n<a

lead.\n\nWinchester then directed the Blue Devils down to the 2-yard line with five seconds on the clock, setting up Joe Zoppi's 19-yard field goal that sent the game into overtime.\n\nIt was St. Francis' third OT in six Northeast Conference games this season, and the Red Flash have yet to win one.\n\nIn overtime, CCSU had first possession and, with two completions, Winchester had the Blue Devils up by seven.\n\nSt. Francis' answering drive stalled at fourth-and-5 when Brown was sacked by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4038041/mike-mushaw\"
