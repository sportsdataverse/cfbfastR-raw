the run, allowing an average of 90.2 yards per game. The Mountain Hawks held the Raiders to just nine net yards on the ground.\n\nColgate scored its first touchdown on a fumble recovery in the end zone by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4579755/prince-ekwughalu\" target=\"_new\">Prince Ekwughalu</a>. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4247543/malik-twyman\" target=\"_new\">Malik Twyman</a> carried three straight times from the Lehigh 14 to give Colgate a 14-7 lead in the second quarter.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4030586/tyler-monaco\" target=\"_new\">Tyler Monaco</a> was 16 of 28 for 231 yards passing and a 19-yard touchdown to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4571842/nate-hope\" target=\"_new\">Nate Hope</a> to start the second quarter. Monaco scored from a yard out to tie game just before intermission.\n\nNeither team scored in the second half until Hill punched through with :33 left in the game.\n\nWith nowhere to run, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4247540/grant-breneman\" target=\"_new\">Grant Breneman</a>, the preseason All-Patriot League quarterback, was 19 of 27 for 204 yards for the Raiders.\n\nThe Mountain Hawks (2-3, 0-1) opened the season with losses to Saint Francis, No. 24 Villanova and No. 4 UC Davis before breaking through with a 10-3 win over Merrimack last week.\n\nDefending Patriot League champion Colgate (0-6, 0-1) opened the season with losses to Villanova, William & Mary, No. 22 Maine, Air Force and Dartmouth. The Raiders find themselves at 0-6 for the first time since 1995 when they went 0-11."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
