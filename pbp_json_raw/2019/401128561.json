touchdowns as the Wildcats used a big second quarter to roll past Butler 52-10 on Saturday.\n\nDugger, a junior, increased his career yardage to 3,247 to pass John Leverett (2001-04), who had 3,165. Dugger also rushed for over 100 yards for the 14th time.\n\nOne of Dugger's touchdowns, an 18-yarder, capped a 33-point second quarter with just over a minute left in the half. He added a 3-yard score in the third quarter.\n\nThree Davidson quarterbacks combined to complete only three of 10 passes but two tosses went for touchdowns, including a 69-yard play from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4248687/louis-colosimo\" target=\"_new\">Louis Colosimo</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4574151/jayden-waddell\" target=\"_new\">Jayden Waddell</a>. The Wildcats rushed for 458 of their 549 total yards.\n\nThe victory gave Davidson (7-3, 4-2 Pioneer Football League) seven wins for the first time since 2002 and four league victories for the first time since 2007.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4367844/nick-orlando\" target=\"_new\">Nick Orlando</a> finished with 107 yards on 19 carries and the only TD for the Bulldogs (2-8, 1-5)."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
