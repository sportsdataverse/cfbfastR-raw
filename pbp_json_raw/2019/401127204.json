dominated the second half to beat Jackson State 36-15 in the MEAC-SWAC Challenge on Sunday at Georgia State Stadium.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4052111/trevor-merritt\" target=\"_new\">Trevor Merritt</a>'s 50-yard interception return got the Wildcats (1-0) on the scoreboard midway

catch and the ensuing 2-point conversion with 2:33 remaining in the quarter gave Bethune-Cookman the lead for good.\n\nLaDarrien Wilson had a 5-yard rushing touchdown early in the fourth before <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4052110/sam-marc\" target=\"_new\">Sam Marc</a> capped the scoring with a 96-yard fumble return.\n\nThe Tigers (0-1) played three quarterbacks due, in part, to disciplinary reasons and as well as injuries.

target=\"_new\">Derrick Ponder</a> to go a combined 16 of 31 for 274 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions -- both by Jones.\n\nJackson State had 512 total yards while limiting the Wildcats to 285, but committed four turnovers and missed two field goals and two PAT attempts.\n\nThe MEAC holds a 10-4 lead in the series with one game canceled by inclement weather."},"videos":[{"source":"espn","id":27517247,"headline":"Johnson finds the end zone for the Jackson State TD","description":"Jackson State's Jordan Johnson scores the 8-yard rushing touchdown
