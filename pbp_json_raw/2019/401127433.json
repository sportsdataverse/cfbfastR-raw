on Saturday to snap a six-game skid.\n\nRosendahl was 22-of-39 passing for 220 yards, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4052137/chris-rowland\" target=\"_new\">Chris Rowland</a> had 12 receptions for 113 yards and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4383603/antonio-zita\" target=\"_new\">Antonio Zita</a> made field goals of 43, 22, 36 and a career-longest 50 yards for Tennessee State. Rowland has 82 receptions this season, a program record.\n\nNewbold's 8-yard touchdown catch gave the Tigers (2-6, 1/3 Ohio Valley Conference) their first lead and capped the scoring with 7:56 to play.\n\nOn the next play from scrimmage, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4051927/javaughn-craig\" target=\"_new\">JaVaughn Craig</a> hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4249040/deangelo-wilson\" target=\"_new\">DeAngelo Wilson</a> for a 53-yard gain to the TSU 22 but the drive stalled and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3927095/logan-birchfield\" target=\"_new\">Logan Birchfield</a>'s 34-yard field-goal attempt missed wide left less than 90 seconds later.

Austin Peay quickly moved to the 21, setting up a 32-yard field-goal attempt by Birchfield with 1:07 to go that was, again, wide left.\n\nThe Governor went into the game ranked No. 19 in the FCS Coaches poll after consecutive wins over then-No. 11 Jacksonville State and then-No. 20 Southeast Missouri."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
