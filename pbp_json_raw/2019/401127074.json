Villanova stretched its lead to 21-7 on Barlee's 15-yard TD run, but Anderson connected with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4050876/zach-burdick\" target=\"_new\">Zach Burdick</a> for a 16-yard score sandwiched around a pair of missed field goals by Villanova's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4051833/drew-kresge\" target=\"_new\">Drew Kresge</a> and the Tribe trailed 21-14 at halftime.\n\nWilliam & Mary knotted the score at 21, using a marathon 17-play drive that covered 76 yards and took 7:36 off the clock with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4574128/bronson-yoder\" target=\"_new\">Bronson Yoder</a> scoring on a 2-yard run.\n\nVillanova recaptured the lead at 28-21 when Smith hooked up with Hayek for a 37-yard score, but Anderson again pulled the Tribe even when he hit Everson for a 20-yard TD on fourth-and-1 with 9:56 remaining in the game.\n\nThe Wildcats took the lead for good with a 16-play drive that took nearly 8 minutes off the clock.\n\nThe Tribe drove to the Villanova 30-yard line before turning the ball over on downs.\n\nSmith completed 21 of 34 passes for 250 yards and three TDs for the Wildcats. Anderson finished 25-of-33 passing for 245 yards and three scores.
