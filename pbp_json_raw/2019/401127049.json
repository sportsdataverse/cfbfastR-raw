completely stymied. After picking up 32 yards on its first possession, Saint Francis had 32 yards on its next nine possessions, all three-and-outs.\n\nVanhorse had a pair of touchdown runs sandwiched around <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3929032/jake-brown\" target=\"_new\">Jake Brown</a>'s 45-yard catch and run for a 21-0 lead early in the second quarter.
