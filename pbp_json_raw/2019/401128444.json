Davis hit Jefferson with a 19-yard stroke as time expired in the first quarter, then hit him from 43 yards out early in the second quarter to put the Hornets up, 14-7.\n\nTaurean Taylor scored on a pair of second-quarter runs to put Tuskegee up, 21-20 at intermission.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4250421/hunter-hanson\" target=\"_new\">Hunter Hanson</a> kicked a 43-yard field goal to cut Alabama State's deficit to a point, 24-23 midway through the third quarter, but Devarens Valcin returned the ensuing kickoff 99 yards to put Tuskegee up, 31-23.\n\nBell broke loose from midfield and scored, then punched in for the two-point conversion to tie the game with 6:41 left in the third quarter.\n\nDavis completed 20 of 30 passes for 347 yards and four touchdowns with an interception. Bell finished with nine carries for 63 yards."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"SIAC -
