YORK --  Quarterback Jake Cirillo passed for 138 yards and rushed for a game-high 90 yards and Division II-member East Stroudsburg defeated Wagner 24-14 on Saturday.\n\nESU scored 21 consecutive points in the first and second quarters and the Warriors (1-0) led 21-7 at halftime.\n\nTrailing 21-14 in the fourth quarter, Wagner drove to the ESU 24 but was backed up by a 3-yard loss on a run followed by a sack, an incomplete pass and a penalty. The Seahawks punted and ESU took six minutes off the clock with a 10-play, 60-yard drive that resulted in a 45-yard field goal by Jordan Walters. Wagner took possession with 1:05 remaining and did not gain a first down.\n\nWagner's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3914306/christian-alexander-stevens\" target=\"_new\">Christian Alexander-Stevens</a> completed 20 of 34 passes for 234 yards and a touchdown but was sacked four times. <a
