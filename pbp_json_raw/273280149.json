(AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159363\">Michael Hobbs</a> scored on a 6-yard run with 32 seconds remaining Saturday to give Wofford a 23-22 victory over previously unbeaten Montana in the first round of the FCS playoffs.\n\nThird-seed Montana (11-1) had a chance to win the game on a 47-yard field goal with 4 seconds remaining, but Dan Carpenter pulled the kick left.\n\nWofford (9-3) will face Richmond at home next week in the second round.\n\nWofford trailed 22-17 with 6 minutes remaining after <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=149243\">Lex Hilliard</a>, who rushed for 119 yards, scored on a 1-yard run for Montana.\n\nThe Terriers drove the field for Hobbs' winning score.\n\nMontana struggled against Wofford's triple option as <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=145334\">Kevious Johnson</a> rushed for 145 yards, while Hobbs had 67, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173094\">Dane Romero</a> 57 and quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=145323\">Josh Collier</a> 54.\n\nRomero scored the first touchdown of the game on a 3-yard run that gave Wofford a 10-3 lead with 10:07 left in the second quarter.\n\nMontana answered with Carpenter's 25-yard field goal and a 9-yard touchdown pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159523\">Cole Bergquist</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172465\">Dan Beaudin</a> to take a 13-10 lead with 24 seconds left in the half.\n\nThe Grizzlies went up 16-10 on Carpenter's 24-yard field goal with 12:59 remaining.\n\nCollier, who passed for 53 yards after throwing two interceptions, hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173097\">Andy Strickland</a> on a 6-yard scoring pass midway through the fourth quarter to give Wofford a 17-16 lead.\n\nMontana's 2-point conversion attempt failed after Hilliard's score, and Wofford was unable to convert after Hobbs' final score, leaving the door open for the Grizzlies."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"East Tennessee
