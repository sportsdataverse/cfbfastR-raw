beat 72-12 win over Valparaiso on Saturday.\n\nButler (8-3, 6-1 Pioneer Football League) broke a school-record for total offense with 717 yards, surpassing its previous best of 673 in a 1989 game against St. Ambrose. Butler's 72 points were its most since scoring 68 against Indianapolis in 1948.\n\nLancaster and Shannon hooked up for first-half touchdown passes of 35, 57 and 51 yards as Butler mounted a 45-12 lead heading into the break. Lancaster finished with 317 yards passing and four touchdowns and Shannon had 142 yards on five receptions.\n\nButler entered the game in a three-way tie for first place in the league and will conclude its conference slate next Saturday at Morehead State.
