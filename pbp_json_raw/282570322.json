two touchdowns in a 24-6 win over visiting Georgetown on Saturday night.\n\nCurley scored on a pair of 1-yard runs for Lafayette (2-0, 1-0 Patriot League) while <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173066\">Maurice White</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185122\">Tyrell Coon</a> combined to rush for 202 yards and a touchdown for the balanced Leopard offense.\n\nOn defense, Lafayette held the Hoyas (1-1, 0-1) to just 70 yards on the ground and blocked a field goal attempt on special teams.\n\nCurley scored on a 1-yard plunge to cap a 10-play, 71-yard drive on the opening possession. In the second quarter, Neil Goldsmith picked off a pass from Georgetown's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=385404\">James Brady</a> and returned it 37 yards to set up Davis Rodriguez's 23-yard field goal that gave the Leopards a 10-0 halftime lead. Coon added a 1-yard TD run in the third quarter to push Lafayette's advantage to 17-0.\n\nThe Hoyas engineered a nine-play, 92-yard touchdown drive capped by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=241283\">Keerome Lawrence</a>'s 2-yard run to get on the board. But Georgetown lost 3 yards on its next two possessions and Curley put the game away with his second touchdown of the night with less than a minute to go.\n\nWhite led the way for Lafayette with 106 yards on 18 carries and Coon had 96 yards on 17 carries.\n\nJames was 12-for-28 for 141 yards and Lawrence threw for 65 yards and ran for 42 to lead the
