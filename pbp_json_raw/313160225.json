defeated Brown 21-16 Saturday.\n\nAfter Schwieger's 1-yard score for the Big Green (4-5, 3-3 Ivy League) with 11:01 remaining, the Bears (7-2, 4-2) drove to the Dartmouth 25, but <a

Andreassi.\n\nThe Big Green controlled the ball for 36:32 to Brown's 23:28, aided by two fourth-down conversions that kept scoring drives alive.\n\nIn the second quarter, Schwieger ran for 5 yards on fourth-and-2 from the Brown 37, and Dartmouth tied the game 7-7 two plays later on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/385905/conner-kempe\" target=\"_new\">Conner Kempe</a>'s

third quarter kept another drive alive, and his 1-yard run three plays later gave Dartmouth a 14-10 lead.\n\nNewhall-Caballero completed 22 of 33 for 252 yards and a touchdown for
