(AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159679\">Tim Hightower</a> rushed for 180 yards and a touchdown and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172969\">Eric Ward</a> threw for one touchdown and ran for another Saturday night, leading Richmond past Eastern Kentucky 31-14 in the first round of the football championship subdivision playoffs.\n\nThe Spiders (10-2) will travel to Wofford next Saturday for a quarterfinal game. Eastern Kentucky, outgained 417-288, finished 9-3.\n\nWard was 13-for-18 for 139 yards and the Spiders' defense helped out with a pair of interceptions and two fumble recoveries. Richmond did not turn the ball over, becoming the first team this season not to commit a giveaway against the Colonels.\n\nHightower scored on a 2-yard run to give Richmond a 14-0 lead, capping a drive set up by David Horton's interception. Hightower also had a 30-yard burst on Richmond's opening drive, which ended with Andrew Howard's 25-yard field goal.\n\nWard's 9-yard scoring run made it 17-0 3:23 before halftime. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172968\">Josh Vaughan</a> added a 40-yard touchdown run and Ward hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191617\">Kevin Grayson</a> for a 5-yard touchdown after halftime.\n\nEastern Kentucky's points came on a 2-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161912\">Bobby Washington</a> and a pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=150790\">Josh Greco</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=150812\">Quinton Williams</a>, the latter on the first play of the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Spiders rushed for 278 yards, the Colonels just 54 yards."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"Sam Houston","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2534/sam-houston","id":"2534","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2534","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"11-1","displayValue":"11-1"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"6-0","displayValue":"6-0"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2534.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2020-11-17T16:28Z"}]},{"team":"Stephen F.
