fourth-quarter touchdown run on Saturday.\n\nThe Wildcats came within 58 seconds of notching their first shutout of the season, but <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3919110/daniel-parr\" target=\"_new\">Daniel Parr</a> connected with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3918080/kareem-coles-jr\" target=\"_new\">Kareem Coles Jr</a>. for a 12-yard TD to provide the final margin of victory.\n\nHughes started the scoring for the Wildcats (2-2) when he capped an eight-play, 42-yard drive with a 45-yard field goal at the 11:16 mark of the first quarter. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4366963/dylan-laube\" target=\"_new\">Dylan Laube</a>'s 6-yard TD run with 15 seconds left in the quarter put New Hampshire up 10-0.\n\nHughes added a 39-yard field goal in the second quarter and a 38-yarder in the third to put the Wildcats up 16-0.\n\nNew Hampshire put the game out of reach when <a

An unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Lacey pushed the ball back 15 yards, but Gray broke loose for a TD on the next play.\n\nBrosmer completed 17 of 31 passes for 202 yards, while Gray finished with 99 yards on 10 carries.\n\nParr was 14-of-32 passing for 183 yards and two interceptions.\n\nNew Hampshire had 433 yards of offense and held the Dukes (2-2) to 233, including just 50 yards on 23
