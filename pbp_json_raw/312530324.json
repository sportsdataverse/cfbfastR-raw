win over Catawba on Saturday night.\n\nHillary was 16 for 24 passing for 220 yards and also had 14 yards on six carries for the Chanticleers (2-0), who held the Division II Indians scoreless in the second half to earn the win.\n\nAfter Grant Clayton's 26-yard field goal opened the scoring for Coastal Carolina, Hillary connected with <a
