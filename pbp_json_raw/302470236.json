href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=381870\" target=\"_new\">DeAndre Presley</a> scooped up a fumble by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190007\" target=\"_new\">Matt Cline</a> after completing a pass to him and ran it in from 33 yards out, capping a 28-point Appalachian State fourth quarter in a 42-41 victory over Chattanooga on Saturday.\n\nIt was the 21st consecutive Southern Conference victory for the Mountaineers, who lost in the Football Championship Series semifinals last season.\n\nChattanooga got within a point on a 3-yard run by quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236000\" target=\"_new\">B.J. Coleman</a> with 51 seconds left. The Mocs tried for a 2-point conversion, but Coleman's pass was incomplete and Appalachian State recovered an onside kickoff.\n\nPresley completed 22 of 29 passes for 340 yards and two touchdowns for the Mountaineers. Coleman was 23-for-37, also for 340 yards, and threw for three touchdowns for the Mocs.\n\nTrailing 35-14 one play into the fourth quarter, Appalachian State tied the game in a span of 3:53. Presley completed passes of 48 and 26 yards to set up <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=240267\" target=\"_new\">Cedric Baker</a>'s 3-yard run to make it 35-21.\n\nBuster Skrine fumbled the ensuing kickoff, suffering a dislocated shoulder on the play, and the Mountaineers got the ball at the Chattanooga 33, leading to a Presley scoring run from the 4.\n\nAppalachian State got the ball back quickly again, at the Chattanooga 11, when Coleman fumbled after being sacked by Jabari Fletcher. Baker scored the tying touchdown on a 7-yard run.\n\nChattanooga led 28-7 at halftime. A 46-yard pass from Coleman to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486133\" target=\"_new\">Brian Sutherland</a> set up a 3-yard second-quarter scoring run by Coleman. The Mocs completed the first-half scoring with a 67-yard drive in three plays. After Sutherland ran for 34 yards and Coleman hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233676\" target=\"_new\">Joel Bradford</a> for 24 yards to the 9, running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486134\" target=\"_new\">Chris Awuah</a> found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486154\" target=\"_new\">Marlon Anthony</a> with a pass for the score.\n\nThe Mocs gained momentum early. Mike Hammons' 29-yard field goal opened the scoring after J.D. Dothard recovered a fumble by Appalachian State's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=237518\" target=\"_new\">Travaris Cadet</a> and returned it 26 yards to the Mountaineers' 25.\n\nAfter an Appalachian State punt, Chattanooga made it 9-0 on a 53-yard pass from B.J. Coleman to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187297\" target=\"_new\">Chris Pitchford</a>. Hammons missed the extra point.\n\nAppalachian State responded with a 52-yard scoring drive, ending in a 2-yard run by Presley, but Coleman's 36-yard scoring pass to Bradford put the Mocs ahead 16-7."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Sun Belt -
