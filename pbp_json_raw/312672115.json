Frazier's 32-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=502621\" target=\"_new\">Neal Sterling</a> and a 41-yard field goal by Eric Spillane accounted for the Hawks' points.\n\nMonmouth then took a 17-0 lead on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=519287\" target=\"_new\">Julian Hayes</a>' 6-yard touchdown run with 12:59 left in the second quarter.\n\nThe deficit would prove too much for the Blue Devils (2-2, 1-1) to overcome as they snapped a 15-game home winning streak. It was tied for the longest active streak in Football Championship Series. Central Connecticut State's prior home loss was 49-14 against Albany on Nov. 17, 2007.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=484266\" target=\"_new\">Brian Fowler</a> scored the
