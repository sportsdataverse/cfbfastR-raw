and ran another as Drake crushed Valparaiso 34-14 Saturday for the Bulldogs' sixth-straight victory against the Crusaders.\n\nDrake (3-1 overall, 2-0 Pioneer) came away with points all five times the Bulldogs got into the red zone. Valparaiso (1-3, 0-1) got within three points at 10-7 early in the second quarter, but couldn't stop Piatkowski.\n\nPiatkowski completed 18 of 31 pass attempts for 207 yards, without an interception. He opened the scoring with a 10-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185907\">Frank Pucher</a> in the first quarter, and hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=388319\">Joey Orlando</a> on a 39-yard scoring pass less than two minutes after Valparaiso scored in the second. Piatkowski added a third TD with a 3-yard scramble before halftime.\n\nDrake's Brandon Wubs nailed two field goals, including a 42-yarder. <a
