href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/485305/dominique-williams\" target=\"_new\">Dominique Williams</a> rushed for four touchdowns and Wagner defeated Robert Morris 38-17 on Saturday, snapping a three-game losing streak in the series.\n\nWilliams rushed for 216 yards and scored on runs on 2, 5 and 56 yards as the Seahawks built a 24-2 halftime lead. Williams, who added a 1-yard touchdown run in the final minute of the game, has gained 1,222 yards this season and cracks the Wagner all-time top-10 list in single-season rushing yards.\n\nThe Seahawks (3-7, 3-4 Northeast Conference), who have won two games in a row, forced three Robert Morris turnovers and held the Colonials without a touchdown until the fourth quarter when <a
