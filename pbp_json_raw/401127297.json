Southeast Missouri State rolled past Southern Illinois 44-26 Thursday night in the 87th meeting between the schools located just 45 miles apart.\n\nThe oldest rivalry for both schools, the game was dubbed \"The War of the Wheel\" in 2018 and the Redhawks have captured the ship's wheel in back-to-back seasons.\n\nJavon Williams punched in from the 1 midway through the first quarter and the Salukis held a 7-0 lead and, after Santacaterina scored from the 3 early in the second quarter, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4043170/dj-davis\" target=\"_new\">D.J.

Senior linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4034545/zach-hall\" target=\"_new\">Zach Hall</a> had a game-high 19 tackles, including a sack.\n\nDavis finished with 125 yards and two touchdowns on the ground for Southern Illinois."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
