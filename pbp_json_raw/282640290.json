remaining to give Elon a 22-20 victory over Georgia Southern on Saturday night.\n\nIt was the fifth field goal of the game for Wilcox, who also connected from 25, 36 and 33 yards and 22 yards for the Phoenix (2-1, 1-0 Southern Conference).\n\nWilcox also had five field goals in a 36-33 double overtime victory over Georgia Southern last season.\n\nIt looked like the Eagles (2-2, 0-1) were going to pull off their third straight fourth-quarter victory, but Wilcox dashed those hopes.\n\nElon led 16-13 at the half, and the two teams played a scoreless third quarter before Georgia Southern's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188307\">Antonio Henton</a> hit Damarcus Watts on a 9-yard touchdown pass with 10:58 to play for a 20-19 lead.\n\nThe Phoenix got the ball at its 20-yard line with 4:41 to play.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233773\">Scott Riddle</a> drove Elon to the Georgia Southern 17 to set up Wilcox's game winner, the key play coming on a 20-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=178004\">Terrell Hudgins</a> on a fourth-and-10 at the Elon 42.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233764\">Sean Jeffcoat</a>'s reception put the ball on Georgia Southern's 26, and three runs moved the ball to the 17 with 10 seconds to play.\n\nRiddle had a 7-yard scoring pass to Hudgins in the second quarter. It was the 39th of his career, setting a school record.\n\nHudgins caught 13 passes for 199 yards to set a Southern Conference record for most receptions in a career. He has 226 catches, breaking the mark of 223 by former teammate Michael Mayes.\n\nGeorgia Southern's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=168785\">Raja Andrews</a> had nine catches to tie a school single game record.\n\nThe Eagles got their lone touchdown on a 94-yard kickoff return by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=387092\">Samair Baker</a> in the second quarter.\n\nAdrian Mora kicked two field goals for Georgia Southern."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
