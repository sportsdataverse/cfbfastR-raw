nationally in rushing offense at 437 yards per game -- they've thrown just 33 passes all season -- but performed well under their average mark and still secured the win. Wofford totaled just 17 fewer yards than the Eagles, and also forced the game's only turnover, but were just 4-for-15 on third down.\n\nThe Terriers (5-1, 3-1) were up 6-0 in the second quarter before Swope's 4-yard TD rush gave Georgia Southern a 10-6 lead before halftime. The Eagles led the rest of the way, getting a 3-yard TD from Swope in the fourth to pad the advantage."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
