quarter. The Dragons closed to within 24-21 on a short Huntley TD pass and a 70-yard punt return by Evelyn. The Dragons eventually tied the game at 31 late in the period.\n\nUAPB went ahead 38-31 on a 9-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4383504/skyler-perry\" target=\"_new\">Skyler Perry</a> before the Huntley-to-Evelyn hookup tied it at 38.\n\nPorter carried 21 times for 182 yards for UAPB (4-2) and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4383503/shannon-patrick\" target=\"_new\">Shannon Patrick</a> threw for 268 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions.\n\nHuntley was 22-of-35 passing for 238 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.
