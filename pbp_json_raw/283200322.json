the final seconds lifted Holy Cross to a 27-26 win over Lafayette on Saturday.\n\nRandolph threw for 422 yards and three touchdowns, including the game-winner to Koster with six seconds left. Matt Partain's extra point provided the winning margin.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=178461\">Brett McDermott</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=189023\">Nick Cole</a> caught touchdown passes from Randolph for Holy Cross (7-3, 5-0 Patriot League). McDermott had eight catches for 107 yards and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=174629\">Jon Brock</a> added six catches for 122 yards for the Crusaders.\n\nLafayette (7-3, 3-2) held a 13-7 halftime lead and extended it to 20-7 early in the third on a 2-yard touchdown run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185141\">DeAndre' Morrow</a>.\n\nBut the Crusaders responded with a 23-yard field goal by Partain later in the third and a 32-yarder early in the fourth. Cole's 22-yard touchdown catch tied the score at 20 with 5:36 left.\n\nMorrow scored on a 22-yard run with 2:45 left, but a missed extra point kept the Leopard lead at 26-20 and gave Holy Cross the chance to win.\n\nMorrow finished with 111 yards on 15 carries and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233236\">Marc Quilling</a> threw for 184 yards and a touchdown for
