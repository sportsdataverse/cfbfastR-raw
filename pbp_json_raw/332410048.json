Jacksonville 51-35 on Thursday night.\n\nPierce carried the ball 16 times for 101 yards, but the Blue Hens had success no matter who got the handoff, with backs at times running freely through the defense.  <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/511868/julian-laing\" target=\"_new\">Julian Laing</a> ran for 97 yards and freshman <a

quarter.\n\nJacksonville's running attack was a no-show with the Dolphins tallying minus 37 yards. Coach Kerwin Bell relied heavily on his quarterback and son, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/516180/kade-bell\" target=\"_new\">Kade Bell</a>, who completed 18 of 34 passes
