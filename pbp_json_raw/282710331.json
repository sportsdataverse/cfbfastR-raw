A 53-yard shovel pass from Hill to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172313\">JD Ponciano</a> early in the second quarter tied the score at 7 for the Bengals. A 49-yard interception return by Phillip Arias set up Hill's 14-yard touchdown toss to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=174844\">Jaron Taylor</a>. Hill's 71-yard touchdown pass to Taylor with 19 seconds left in the first half tied the score at 21.\n\nAided by a facemask penalty against Eastern Washington, Idaho State took the second-half kickoff and marched 80 yards to grab a 28-21 lead, its first lead of the season.\n\nThe Eagles responded with Nichols' third scoring pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171140\">Aaron Boyce</a>, a 35-yarder that tied the score at 28.
