over Sacred Heart in both teams' final regular-season game Saturday.\n\nDi Lella finished with 165 passing yards for the Great Danes, who earned a share of the Northeast Conference championship and their first trip to the FCS playoffs with the win.\n\nAlbany (8-3, 7-1) broke a 14-14 halftime tie by scoring on consecutive possessions in the third quarter. After defensive tackle Zach Gallo intercepted a <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/485223/tim-little\" target=\"_new\">Tim Little</a> pass, Di Lella later tossed a 14-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/478235/ryan-kirchner\" target=\"_new\">Ryan Kirchner</a>. The Great Danes followed with a 10-play drive that resulted in Herb Glass' 31-yard field goal and a 24-14 advantage.\n\nSacred Heart (5-6, 3-5) responded on Little's 31-yard strike to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/478381/sean-kessler\" target=\"_new\">Sean Kessler</a> to pull within 24-21 going into the fourth.
