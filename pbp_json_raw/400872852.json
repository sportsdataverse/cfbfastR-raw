converted one of three turnovers into points to beat Eastern Kentucky 24-0 on Saturday in a regular-season finale.\n\nChurch gained 177 yards on 25 carries and became the 12th running back in EIU history to gain 1,000 yards in a season. He scored on an 8-yard run in the third quarter.\n\nIt was the EIU's first shutout since its 31-0 win over Indiana State on Sept. 12, 2009.\n\nPilson's 3-yard TD run capped a five-play, 34-yard second-quarter drive and was set up by an Eastern Kentucky fumble on a punt return. The Panthers (6-5, 4-4 Ohio Valley) couldn't cash in on another fumble and an interception.\n\nMcCullough scored on a 4-yard run in the fourth quarter after Church ran for 68 yards on the previous play.\n\nThe Panthers outgained the Colonels 431-152 in total yards and held Eastern Kentucky (3-8, 2-6) to 68 yards rushing."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
