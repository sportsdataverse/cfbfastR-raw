<a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171049\">Chris Zardas</a> for the final yard, marking the only scoring in the second half.\n\nUMass (7-5, 3-4 Colonial Athletic

in the fourth quarter.

The Minutemen traveled 74 yards in nine plays, with Nelson going over from the one.\n\nLess than two minutes later, they went the short route, picking up a Hofstra fumble on the 15. Nelson then carried 14 yards to the one, then hit the end zone to give his team its 2-touchdown lead.\n\nHofstra finally got on the board, completing a 66-yard drive as Everette Benjamin ran the last 11 for a score.\n\nWith 7 seconds left in the first quarter, UMass went up 21-7 on an 8-yard pass from Coen to <a href=\"http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=157918\">Ian
