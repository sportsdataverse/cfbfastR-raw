(1-2).\n\nEastern Kentucky built what seemed to be a safe 16-0 lead with 9:55 left and the Eagles having mustered only five first downs when Morehead State (1-2) took over on its own 25-yard line.\n\nBut Morehead State's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187750\">Evan Sawyer</a> found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187755\">Jerrod

the 40-yard line before Sawyer's pass was picked off by Brandon Gathof at the 14-yard line with 2:34 left.\n\nEastern Kentucky's <a
