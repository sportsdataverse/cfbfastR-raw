href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161705\">Rhett Bomar</a> threw five touchdown passes and rushed for another, leading Sam Houston State in a 49-33 victory against Gardner-Webb on Saturday night.\n\nBomar completed 22 of 29 passes for 340 yards and no interceptions for the Bearkats (2-1).\n\nSam Houston State started the scoring in the opening quarter with a 19-yard pass from Bomar to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=380074\">Jason Madkins</a>, but the Bulldogs (2-2) tied the score 7-7 on a 2-yard scoring run from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160856\">Brandon Jackson</a> with 9:57 remaining in the frame.\n\nBomar connected with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=196714\">James Aston</a> on touchdown passes of 10- and 23-yards to give the Bearkats a 21-10 lead in the first.\n\nBomar threw a 40-yard touchdown to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171723\">Justin Wells</a>. Then Bomar added a 7-yard scoring pass to Madkins, helping the Bearkats to a 42-10 halftime lead.\n\nBut after Bomar opened the third quarter with a 2-yard scoring run that put the Bearkats up 49-10, Gardner-Webb would respond with 23-consecutive points to get back into the game.\n\nRyan Gates hit field goals of 47, 22 and 26 yards, but fourth-quarter touchdown passes by Doolittle and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162458\">Devin Campbell</a> were not enough for the Bulldogs in the end.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186410\">Stan Doolittle</a> was 24 of 39 passing for 192 yards with a touchdown and no interceptions for
