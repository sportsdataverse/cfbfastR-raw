href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171216\">Ramses Barden</a> caught three touchdown passes and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171203\">James Noble</a> ran for two more scores as No. 8 Cal Poly defeated South Dakota 49-22 in a Great West Conference game Saturday at Alex G. Spanos Stadium.\n\nBarden caught five passes for 158 yards while Noble rushed for 109 yards on just 10 carries for Cal Poly (3-1). South Dakota, which lost despite accumulating 447 yards in total offense, fell to 2-4. The Coyotes are in their first year of transition to Division I.\n\nCal Poly jumped to a 21-0 lead in the first 11 minutes of the game and never looked back. Barden caught scoring passes of 34 and 10 yards from senior quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233053\">Jonathan Dally</a>, sandwiched around a 34-yard touchdown run by Noble for the quick 21-0 lead with 4:24 left in the opening period.\n\nBarden caught a 16-yard touchdown pass from Dally with a minute to go before halftime as Cal Poly went into the locker room with a 28-7 advantage.\n\nIn the third period, Noble and Dally each ran one yard for a Mustang touchdown and a 42-7 cushion.\n\nJunior fullback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=174219\">Jon Hall</a> notched the final Cal Poly score, a 47-yard run down the right sideline with 9:33 to play.\n\nSouth Dakota junior quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=197814\">Noah Shepard</a> accounted for all three of his teams touchdowns. He ran one yard in the second period for his first touchdown, one yard for another score early in the fourth quarter and two yards for the Coyotes final score with 3:30 to go in the game. Shepard finished with 92 yards on 12 rushes and completed 18 of 34 passes for 211 yards.\n\nCal Poly has its third bye of the season next week, returning to action Oct. 18 at South Dakota State in Brookings, S.D."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"North Dakota
