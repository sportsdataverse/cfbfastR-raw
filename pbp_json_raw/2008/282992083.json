Saturday.\n\nEachus carried the ball 36 times and scored two touchdowns in the first half and broke free for a 48-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter for Colgate (6-2, 2-0 Patriot League).\n\nThe Raiders' punishing ground attack churned out 424 yards and five touchdowns and set up opportunities for quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233159\">Greg Sullivan</a>, who completed just seven passes but threw for two touchdowns and also rushed for 79 yards and another score.\n\nBucknell (4-3, 1-1) got two touchdown passes from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188852\">Marcello Trigg</a> and an outstanding performance from receiver Shaun Pasternack, who had eight catches for 150 yards caught a 59-yard TD pass in the second quarter. But the Bison could not slow Colgate's dominating running game, which averaged 6.4 yards per carry.\n\nBucknell built a 14-10 lead in the first quarter, but the Raiders outscored the Bison 21-7 in the second -- getting touchdown runs from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=381837\">Jordan McCord</a> and Eachus and a 14-yard TD pass from Sullivan to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233154\">Doug Rosnick</a> with five seconds left -- to take a 31-21 lead into halftime.\n\nSullivan threw his second touchdown pass of the game, a 4-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172234\">Eric Tupta</a>, in the third and scored on a 12-yard run early in the fourth before Eachus' 48-yard TD run.\n\n<a
