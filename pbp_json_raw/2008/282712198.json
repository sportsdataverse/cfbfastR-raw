Flanker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186552\">Cody Watts</a> took a lateral from quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161175\">Allan Holland</a> and fired a 29-yard scoring strike to flanker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191284\">Shannon Davis</a> just 16 seconds into the game to put the Colonels on the way to their 22nd straight win over the Govs (0-5, 0-2 OVC).\n\nLong added a 27-yard field goal with 3:52 left in the first quarter.\n\nAustin Peay kept the game close when it came up with a fumble recovery by defensive back Jason Vanatta who fell on a <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173295\">C.J. Walker</a> fumble on the Govs' one-yard line with just over three minutes left in the first half.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=189462\">T.C.

Senior wideout <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=157694\">Stephon Fuqua</a> had six receptions for 104 yards.\n\nJennings was 12-of-23 for 90 yards and a TD for Austin Peay.
