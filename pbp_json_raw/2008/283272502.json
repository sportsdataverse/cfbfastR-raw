The Vikings tied the score on Hubel's 21-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=379190\">Lavonte Kirven</a> and took the lead before halftime when Hubel connected with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=240584\">Mario D'Ambrosio</a> on a 14-yard pass.\n\nThe Vikings managed only a 48-yard field goal by Danny Urrego the rest of the way. The field goal was Urrego's 15th of the season, breaking the school's single-season record.\n\nNorthern Colorado closed the gap to 24-21 with four minutes left, when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=232026\">Bryan Waggener</a> capped a four-play, 66-yard drive with a 10-yard scoring toss to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=165069\">Cory Fauver</a>. The Bears, however, would not get their hands on the ball the rest of the way.\n\nWaggener completed 24 of 38 passes for 254 yards.
