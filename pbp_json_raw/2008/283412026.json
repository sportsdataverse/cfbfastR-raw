href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172968\">Josh Vaughan</a> ran for 133 yards and three touchdowns to help Richmond upset defending national champion Appalachian State 33-13 on Saturday in the Football Championship Subdivision playoffs.\n\nThe Spiders (11-3) advance to the FCS -- formerly Division 1-AA -- semifinals for the second consecutive year. Richmond will face Northern Iowa, which defeated New Hampshire 36-34 on Saturday night, next Friday or Saturday.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190009\">Armanti Edwards</a> threw for 323 yards and one touchdown and ran for another score for the three-time FCS champion Mountaineers (11-3). But Edwards also threw a career-worst five interceptions in the second half, leading to four Richmond scores.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172969\">Eric Ward</a> also had a rushing score, and Andrew Howard and Brian Radford both added field goals for the Spiders.\n\nAppalachian State took a 7-0 lead late in the first quarter, driving 95 yards -- aided by a 15-yard face mask call, and a pass interference in the end zone on Richmond -- before Edwards scored on a 2-yard run with 2:58 left.\n\nThe Spiders had a chance to tie the game with Vaughan scoring on a 13-yard run with 4.2 seconds left in the first quarter to pull the score to 7-6. Howard bounced his extra-point attempt off the right upright.\n\nRichmond then took the lead on Howard's 36-yard field goal with 9:05 left in the third quarter, with back-to-back interceptions by Seth Williams to set up TD runs of 1 yard by Vaughan and 5 yards by Ward to put the Spiders ahead 23-7.\n\nThe Mountaineers pulled within 23-13 on Edwards' 4-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=180781\">T.J. Courman</a> with 1:51 left in the third quarter, but Richmond took advantage of two more interceptions to add a 27-yard field goal by Radford and a 1-yard Vaughan TD
