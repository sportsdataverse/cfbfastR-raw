Michael York's kick was good to tie it 35-35.\n\nAfter Ireland's kick with 2:11 left in the game, Northern Colorado marched down the field. On third and 10 at the Texas State 31-yard line, Waggener completed a 30-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162903\">Ryan Chesla</a> to get to the 1-yard line. With 19 seconds left, Waggener fumbled on the next play, and Texas State (2-1) recovered to seal the win.\n\nWaggener was 31-for-51 passing for 392 yards with three touchdowns and an interception.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234623\">Clint Toon</a> completed 18 passes on 32 attempts for 227 yards, an interception and a touchdown in his first start
