href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=189783\">R.J. Toman</a> passed for 255 yards and four touchdowns to lead New Hampshire to a 32-24 victory over Albany on Saturday.\n\nAlbany's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185235\">Vinny Esposito</a> completed 21 of 31 for 283 yards and one touchdown.\n\nUNH, 3-0, scored less than a minute and a half into the game when Toman and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=189781\">Scott Sicko</a> connected on a 65-yard pass, the first of Sicko's two touchdown catches, before Albany, 1-2, scored 17 straight. Herb Glass hit a 47-yard field goal, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185247\">David McCarty</a> scored on a 19-yard run and Esposito romped 11 yards on a quarterback sneak for a 17-7 lead.\n\nToman made it 17-14 at the end of the first half with a 19-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185600\">Chad Kackert</a>. Two errant Albany snaps early in the 3rd quarter set up the next two UNH scores -- a 24-yard pass from Toman to Sicko and a safety after punter Chris Lynch scooped up a bad pass at his 20 and flipped the ball out of the end zone.\n\nAlbany marched 77 yards to take a 24-23 lead on a 19-yard pass from Esposito to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185243\">Chris Kenneally</a> mid-way through the 3rd quarter. Then Toman hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=163807\">Mike Boyle</a> with a 24-yarder to give UNH a 29-24 lead. A two-point pass attempt failed, but Tom Manning finished the scoring with a 45-yard field goal four seconds into the 4th quarter."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
