34-14 victory over Towson on Saturday.\n\nPhillips finished 21-for-32 for 265 yards and three touchdowns, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=380816\">Jonathan Grimes</a> ran for 96 yards and a score for the Tribe (6-2, 4-1 Colonial Athletic Association), which won their fourth straight game and improved to 6-0 all-time against the Tigers (3-6, 1-4).\n\nBrian Pate kicked two field goals for William & Mary, which rolled up 504 offensive yards to Towson's 238.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171064\">Sean Schaefer</a> was 21-for-32 for 186 yards and two touchdowns for Towson, but William & Mary scored on its first possession of the second half and a critical turnover gave the Tribe the lead for good early in the third period.\n\nPhillips directed a 10-play, 80-yard drive capped by a 19-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185451\">Chase Hill</a>, tying the score at 14-14
