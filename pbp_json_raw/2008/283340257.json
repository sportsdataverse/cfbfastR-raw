The Colonels (8-4) had a seven-game winning streak snapped and dropped their 13th straight non-conference road game.\n\nWard was 16 of 23, completing seven passes to Gray for 87 yards. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191617\">Kevin Grayson</a> caught five passes for 107 yards.\n\nRichmond's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172968\">Josh Vaughan</a> rushed for 90 yards on 23 carries.\n\nThe Spiders broke a 10-10 halftime tie by scoring on their first four possessions of the second half.\n\nAfter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159677\">Shawn White</a> returned a short kickoff to the Eastern Kentucky 34, a pair of catches gave the Spiders a first-and-goal on the 9, and Vaughan scored on an 11-yard run around the left side.\n\nThe next drive began on the 20 following Patrick Weldon's interception. Ward and Gray connected on a 14-yard score.\n\nGray's leaping, 23-yard touchdown catch pushed the Spiders' lead to 31-10 with 13:38 remaining in the game.\n\nThe Colonels failed on a fourth-and-4 from their 38 setting up the Spiders' final scoring drive. Vaughan then scored on a 17-yard run.\n\nThe teams traded turnovers in a scoreless first quarter with each quarterback throwing an interception and the Spiders losing a fumbled punt.\n\nThe Colonels had a second fumble recovery deep in Richmond territory negated by a penalty for roughing the punt receiver.\n\nThe Colonels began a drive on their 20 late in the first quarter and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186552\">Cody Watts</a> replaced <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161175\">Allan Holland</a> as quarterback. The new-look offense was successful, moving 48 yards before stalling for a 49-yard field goal by Taylor Long.\n\nRichmond took the lead on a 45-yard pass from Ward to Grayson.\n\nEastern Kentucky capped a 92-yard scoring drive with Holland's 1-yard run. The Colonels began with 2:07 left and Holland completed six straight passes, the last a 48-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186551\">Garnett Phelps</a> to Richmond's 1.\n\nThe Spiders retaliated with Andrew Howard's 26-yard field goal after Ward had completed passes of 27 and 19 yards. The Colonels stuffed Richmond's running attack in the first half, holding the Spiders to 30 yards on 16 carries.\n\nThe Spiders finished with 412 yards, controlling the ball for 36:09, 12:35 in the fourth quarter.\n\nEastern Kentucky was limited to 84 yards rushing, the sixth straight game the Spiders have held their opponents to less than 100 yards rushing. Holland was 20 for 35 for 181 yards."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"Sam Houston","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2534/sam-houston","id":"2534","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2534","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"11-1","displayValue":"11-1"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"6-0","displayValue":"6-0"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2534.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2020-11-17T16:28Z"}]},{"team":"Stephen F.
