pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=237567\">Jared Turcotte</a> on the University of Maine's first play in the second overtime and Brian Harvey kicked the clinching extra point, lifting the team to a 41-40 victory over Hofstra University on Saturday night.\n\nBrusko rushed for 113 yards on 19 carries and scored a touchdown. He also completed eight of 14 passes for 155 yards and two scores.\n\nTurcotte piled up 120 yards on 13 carries, including a 71-yard touchdown burst late in the third quarter. He also made five catches for 69 yards.\n\nThe Black Bears (4-3, 2-2 Colonial Athletic Association), who earned their second straight win, broke loose for 336 yards during the second half and overtimes after being limited to 95 total yards in the first half.\n\nFreshman tailback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=237519\">Derek Session</a> had a 38-yard touchdown catch from Brusko and also turned in scoring runs of 2 and 4 yards.\n\nMaine stormed to a 13-0 lead in the first two minutes of the game, before Hofstra (3-4, 1-2 CAA) rallied to score 20 unanswered points and gain a 20-13 advantage early in the third quarter. The seesaw affair that ensued went to overtime, where both teams scored on their first possession.\n\nIn the second OT, Hofstra scored first on a 2-yard pass from freshman <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=381305\">Steve Probst</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187135\">Everette Benjamin</a>, but Roger Williams' kick went wide left.\n\nBackup quarterback Steve Probst replaced injured starter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234261\">Cory Christopher</a> in the second quarter and kept Hofstra in the contest. He went 14-for-20 passing for 135 yards and three touchdowns and ran the ball 16 times for 63 yards.\n\nWide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162301\">Ottis Lewis</a> led the Pride with nine receptions for 77 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nLinebacker Andrew Downey racked up 19 tackles and forced a fumble to pace the Maine defense and end Jovan Belcher was in on 16.\n\nLinebacker Chris Edmond posted 13 tackles and recovered two fumbles for Hofstra."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
