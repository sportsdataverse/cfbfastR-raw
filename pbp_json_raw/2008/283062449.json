The Bison limited the Sycamores to 19 yards of offense in the second half.\n\nMertens threw for 82 yards for NDSU (5-4, 3-3 Missouri Valley Football Conference), which has won back-to-back games for the first time since the first two weeks of the season. Mertens tossed a 15-yard TD pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161977\">Alex Belquist</a> in the first half and a 4-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161981\">Tyler Jangula</a> early in the fourth quarter.\n\nNDSU's offense struggled in the first half before scoring twice in the last 1:20 of the second quarter to go up 20-7. The Sycamores (0-9, 0-5) outgained the Bison 124-117 in the first two quarters.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161983\">Tyler Roehl</a> ran 20 times for 102 yards, including a 5-yard TD run in the first quarter.

Brown led the Sycamores with 70 yards on 11 carries.\n\nIndiana State, which was outgained 247-143, ran for 103 yards.\n\nIndiana State hasn't won a conference road game since
