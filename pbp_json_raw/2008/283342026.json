href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190009\">Armanti Edwards</a> passed for a school record 433 yards and four touchdowns and rushed for another to lead Appalachian State to a 37-21 victory against South Carolina State on Saturday in the first round of the Football Championship Subdivision playoffs.\n\nThe Mountaineers (11-2), three-time reigning Subdivision champions who were unbeaten in the Southern Conference this season, notched their first 400-yard passing game during the postseason in school history. Appalachian State, which will host Richmond in the quarterfinals on Dec. 6, didn't have a single rushing yard by a running back in the first half.\n\nRichmond beat Eastern Kentucky 38-10 on Saturday.\n\nAppalachian State tried to run out the clock with less than two minutes left and a 10-point lead, but South Carolina State (10-3) called timeout twice on the drive. The Mountaineers countered with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Edwards to Quick in the final seconds, setting off a celebration from the Mountaineers' bench.\n\nEdwards shook off three straight three-and-outs early in the second half to lead Appalachian State back from a 14-10 deficit. After taking the lead just before halftime on a 27-yard hook up between Edwards and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190019\">CoCo Hillary</a>, Edwards scored from 2-yards out on the ground to extend the Mountaineers' lead to 10 at the start of the third.
