href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=181074\">Mike McLeod</a> rushed for three touchdowns as Yale snapped a two-game losing streak with a 27-12 victory Saturday over error-prone Columbia.\n\nColumbia (1-6, 1-3 Ivy League) outgained Yale 316-269, but turned the ball over three times and suffered a blocked punt.\n\nMcLeod, the Ivy League's most valuable player last season, rushed for 85 yards on 23 carries and caught three passes or 25 yards for Yale (4-3, 2-2). Bothered by a lingering ankle sprain much of the season, McLeod had scored only three touchdowns in the Bulldogs' first six games.\n\nMcLeod rushed for touchdowns of 8 and 1 yards in the first half, the latter set up by a blocked Columbia punt returned by Yale's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233530\">Shane Bannon</a> to the Lions' 2-yard line. That gave the Bulldogs a 14-6 halftime lead.\n\nYale defensive lineman Kyle Hawari forced a third-quarter fumble by sacking Columbia quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190763\">M.A. Olawale</a> deep in his own territory, setting up McLeod's final touchdown, a two-yard run.\n\nColumbia scored its only touchdown when backup quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=175643\">Shane Kelly</a> finished an 80-yard drive with a 10-yard run late in the third quarter."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
