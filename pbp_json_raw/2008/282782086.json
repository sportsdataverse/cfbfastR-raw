interception return and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234521\">Ryan Hitchcock</a> added a clinching 15-yard touchdown run as Butler beat Drake 21-15 today. The win snapped a nine-game losing streak for the Bulldogs in the Pioneer Football League.\n\nIt also ended a three-game slide at home for Butler (3-1, 1-0).\n\nDrake (2-3, 0-2) got two field goals by Logan Rees in the second quarter pulled within 7-6 before the long interception return by Blevins late in the period. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185729\">Ben
