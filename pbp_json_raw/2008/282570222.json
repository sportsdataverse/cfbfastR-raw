Lehigh on Saturday.\n\nOsayi Osunde added a 56-yard interception return for the Wildcats (1-1), who bottled up Lehigh's ground attack and picked off quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=240503\">J.B. Clark</a> four times.\n\nMarcoux kicked field goals of 44 and 23 yards sandwiched around Osunde's interception return in the second quarter. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191307\">Aaron Ball</a> added a 1-yard touchdown run with 1:33 left in the half to give Villanova a 20-7 halftime lead.\n\nThe Wildcats put the game away in the third quarter with another 44-yard field goal by Marcoux and Young's 20-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=158902\">Phil Atkinson</a>, which capped an 80-yard drive that used up more than seven minutes on the clock.\n\nLehigh (1-1) got a touchdown pass from Clark to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171586\">Sekou Yansane</a> early in the fourth quarter, but Marcoux added one more field goal for the final margin.\n\nThe Wildcats set up two of Marcoux's field goals with interceptions by Fred Maldonado and Ross Ventrone.\n\nLehigh's only first-half score came on a 3-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159678\">Matt McGowan</a> that was set up when Tim Diamond forced a fumble by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=380066\">Lawrence Doss</a> and recovered it at the Villanova 3-yard line.\n\nThe Wildcats held Lehigh to just 38 yards on 23 carries and sacked Clark three times."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"Holy
