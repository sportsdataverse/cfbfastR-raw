href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=158648\">Cole Ingle</a> threw for 196 yards and two touchdowns and the defense forced three turnovers and recorded a safety as Drake beat Morehead State Saturday 19-15.\n\nDrake (5-4, 3-3 Pioneer Football League) took a 10-6 lead on Ingle's 38-yard throw to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=379620\">Andrew Blackmon</a>.\n\nBut it was Drake's defense which came up big in stopping Morehead State. The Drake defense recorded seven quarterback sacks and had three interceptions.\n\nMorehead State (4-6, 2-4 PFL) pulled to within 10-9, but Drake responded with a four-play 55-yard drive that ended with Ingle hitting <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=245900\">Michael Lahart</a> on a seven-yard touchdown pass just before the half.\n\nMorehead State kicker Mason Webb made field goals from 32, 37 and 30 yards in the first half, but had a 30-yard attempt blocked by Drake's David Witkiewicz in the third quarter.\n\nDrake held a narrow 17-15 lead late in the game when <a
