first possession of overtime as Villanova defeated local rival Penn 20-14 on Saturday.\n\nPenn blocked the extra-point attempt after Whitney scored, but the Quakers fumbled on their first play and Villanova's Salim Koroma recovered the ball to clinch the win for the Wildcats (2-1).\n\nVillanova starting quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172065\">Antwon Young</a> completed 16 of 26 passes for 172 yards and one touchdown, but also had four interceptions. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=174254\">Robert Irvin</a> was 15-for-23 for 179 yards and a touchdown for the Quakers (0-1), who lost to the Wildcats for the seventh straight time since the series was resumed in 1999.\n\nPenn led 14-7 on a 12-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233350\">Michael DiMaggio</a> with 9:56 left in the second quarter, but Villanova tied the score four plays later on a 38-yard pass play from Young to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234103\">Matthew Szczur</a>.\n\nNeither team scored in the second half, although Villanova threatened on three occasions but was stopped by Penn's interceptions.\n\nWhitney replaced Young late in the game and completed 1 of 2 passes for 10 yards and carried four times for 25 yards and a touchdown.\n\nVillanova now has an 8-5 lead in the overall series, which started in 1905 -- but the teams didn't play from 1912 to 1999."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
