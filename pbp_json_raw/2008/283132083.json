href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233236\">Marc Quilling</a>'s three touchdown passes led Lafayette to a 38-21 win over Bucknell on Saturday.\n\nQuilling's passing led a balanced offensive attack for Lafayette (7-2, 3-1 Patriot League) while the Leopard defense forced three turnovers.\n\nQuilling opened the scoring with a 23-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173063\">Joe Russo</a> midway through the first quarter. He had a 51-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173050\">Michael Conte</a> in the third quarter and capped the scoring with a TD strike to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173044\">Shaun Adair</a> early in the fourth.\n\nRusso added a touchdown run and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185122\">Tyrell Coon</a> rushed for 169 yards and a touchdown as the Leopards dominated Bucknell (4-5, 1-3), outgaining the Bison 474 yards to 222.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233197\">Shaun Pasternak</a> caught touchdown passes of 8 yards from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185249\">Andrew Lair</a> and 37 yards from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188847\">Justin Pulgrano</a> for Bucknell. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188840\">A.J. Kizekai</a> returned a kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown in the first quarter for the Bison.\n\nDavis Rodriguez booted a 20-yard field goal with one second left in the second quarter to give Bucknell at 17-14 lead going into halftime.\n\nIn the third quarter, Quilling hooked up with Conte for a long touchdown and Bucknell responded with Pasternak's second TD catch of the day to cut Lafayette's lead to 24-21.\n\nLafayette needed just five plays to drive 74 yards on the next possession, capped by Coon's 3-yard TD run. Quilling put the game out of reach in the fourth with his 34-yard TD pass to Adair."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
