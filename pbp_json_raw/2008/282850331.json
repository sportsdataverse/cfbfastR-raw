Nichols, who entered the game averaging nearly 344 yards passing with 12 touchdown passes, was limited to 19-of-45 for 191 yards.\n\nBergquist finished 15-of-25 for 199 yards for Montana, which had no turnovers after giving up the ball nine times in its previous two games.\n\nMariani caught five passes for 118 yards for the Grizzlies, who have won three straight against the Eagles and five of the last six meetings between the teams.\n\nEastern Washington had a chance to strike first, marching the opening kickoff to the Montana 25. Running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=169082\">Alexis Alexander</a> raced 22 yards on a sweep before fumbling into the end zone, where it was recovered by the
