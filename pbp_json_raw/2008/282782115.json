After Wagner's Eric Ortiz kicked a 29-yard field goal to make it 14-10, the Blue Devils responded by going 70 yards on 10 plays on the ensuing drive, capped by a 1-yard touchdown dive by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=165286\">Josh Vargas</a> with 5:21 left in the third quarter.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=176888\">Jermaine Roberts</a> then scored on a reverse from 16 yards out, racing down the left side behind the blocking of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191103\">Greg Grochowski</a> to make it 28-10 early in the fourth.\n\nThe Blue Devils went 76 yards on nine plays on the drive, taking more than five minutes off the clock and breaking the backs of the Seahawks.\n\nWagner (2-3, 0-1 NEC) had put up quite a fight for much of the game, however. Central (3-2, 1-0) opened the scoring just 3:32 into the game when Roberts caught an 18-yard touchdown pass from Aubrey Norris.\n\nCentral's other quarterback, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=380182\">Hunter Wanket</a>, threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191122\">Tyler Rossnagle</a> with 2:04 left in the first quarter to push the CCSU lead to 14-0, but the Seahawks rallied.\n\nWagner went 70 yards on 10 plays, with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=241498\">Morgan Mizell</a> catching a 7-yard touchdown pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188275\">Adam Farnsworth</a> to cut the lead to 14-7.\n\nNorris hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191096\">Nick Colagiovanni</a> for a 69-yard scoring strike with 5:49 left in the game to cap the scoring.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=176875\">James Mallory</a> finished with 75 yards on 23 carries, while Roberts scored on both of his touches and Rossnagle caught three balls for 43 yards. Wanket was 4-for-8 for 71 yards and a score.\n\nWagner was led by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234313\">Tyrone Collins</a>' 10 catches for 93 yards and Ryan Middleton's 86 rushing yards on just seven carries."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
