href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190009\">Armanti Edwards</a> and the Mountaineers reminded them Friday that the three-time defending national champions are still dominant in college football's second tier.\n\nThe dynamic Edwards was nearly perfect, throwing for a career-high 367 yards and five touchdowns and rushing for another score in Appalachian State's 70-24 rout of Wofford.\n\nThe Mountaineers (7-2, 5-0 Southern Conference) scored TDs on their first six possessions to win their sixth straight game, and Edwards completed 17 of 19 passes and surpassed 9,000 yards of total offense in his career, a league record.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234141\">Brian Quick</a> was his favorite target, catching four passes for 172 yards and three TDs. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234138\">Ben Jorden</a> caught two more scores, while safety Mark LeGree had three interceptions in slowing one of the top offenses in the championship subdivision.\n\nWhile they don't have a jaw-dropping win this year like last season's stunning win over Michigan, Appalachian State showed a national television audience it has recovered from a 1-2 start that included losses to LSU and James Madison.\n\nBy improving to 39-1 in their last 40 home games, the Mountaineers also set themselves up for a December of home playoff games as they try to win a fourth straight FCS title.\n\nWofford (6-2, 4-1) scored touchdowns on its first two possessions, but its option offense couldn't keep up. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173101\">Ben Widmyer</a> threw his first two interceptions of the season, completing 5 of 10 passes for 74 yards and rushing for a TD before he was replaced late in the third quarter. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173094\">Dane Romero</a> rushed for 106 yards and two touchdowns for the Terriers, whose lone loss before Friday came at South Carolina.\n\nWofford, which handed Appalachian State one of its two losses last year, gave up the most points since it moved to Division I in 1997, unable to contain the Mountaineers quick-strike offense.\n\nThe longest of Appalachian State's touchdown drives lasted less than 5 minutes. Edwards tossed 23- and 48-yard touchdown passes to Jorden. The left-hander showed his arm strength on TD strikes of 58, 50 and 31 yards to the speedy Quick. Their first TD gave Appalachian State a 35-14 lead with 10:59 left in the second quarter.\n\nEdwards also rushed for 73 yards and a 1-yard TD, finishing with 440 yards of total offense. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=183570\">Devin Radford</a> added 69 yards rushing a TD.\n\nIt took much of the luster off what was a matchup of teams ranked in the top five of both FCS polls, which produced a school-record crowd of 30,931.\n\nWofford, which came with only five turnovers, were undone early when LeGree picked off Widmyer shortly after Appalachian State took the lead for good at 21-14. LeGree got Widmyer again in the third quarter, and picked off backup <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234576\">Mitch Allen</a> in the fourth."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"East Tennessee
