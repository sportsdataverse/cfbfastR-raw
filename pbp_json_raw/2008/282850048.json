27-10 victory over Delaware on Saturday night.\n\nThe Black Bears (3-3, 1-2 Colonial Athletic Association) also forced five turnovers against the Blue Hens (2-4, 0-2).\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=177699\">Michael Brusko</a> scored on a 5-yard run with 11:35 remaining to snap a 10-10 tie and give Maine its first lead. The touchdown came two plays after Mark Masterson's fumble recovery gave the Black Bears possession at Delaware's 28.\n\nJerron McMillian's interception at the Black Bears' 46 led to Brian Harvey's 31-yard field goal that pushed Maine's lead to 20-10 with 3:42 left in the game.\n\nMaine's Jordan Stevens then stripped <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=174008\">Robby Schoenhoft</a> as he was being sacked and returned the fumble 35 yards for a touchdown with 1:29 remaining.\n\nIn the third quarter, an interception by the Black Bears' Sean Wasson at the goal line ended a Delaware drive.\n\nSchoenhoft, a transfer from Ohio State, completed 29-of-48 passes for 344 yards but threw three interceptions.\n\nDelaware outgained Maine 362-258.\n\nMaine quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191757\">Adam Farkes</a> left the game with an apparent shoulder injury after taking a hard hit in the second quarter and didn't return. Brusko replaced him and completed 5-of-7 passes for 65 yards, and rushed for 40 yards on nine carries.\n\nThe two teams traded touchdowns in the second quarter, leading to a 10-10 halftime tie. Schoenhoft hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187201\">Tommy Crosby</a> on a crossing pattern for a 33-yard pass for Delaware's touchdown.\n\nMaine had to go only 39 yards for its touchdown late in the second quarter. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=237567\">Jared Turcotte</a> capped the drive with a 4-yard scoring run with 26 seconds remaining before halftime."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
