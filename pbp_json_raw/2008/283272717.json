Wofford defeated Furman 35-10, but needed a Western Carolina victory to gain a share of the title.\n\nInstead, Appalachian State won its ninth straight game and likely secured a top-four seed in the Football Championship Subdivision playoffs, which start next weekend.\n\nWestern Carolina (3-9, 1-7), leading 10-7 at halftime, lost 14 yards in the third quarter and surrendered 28 unanswered points. The Catamounts failed to convert a first down on nine straight possessions spanning the first and second halves.\n\nEdwards suffered a hip injury last week against Elon and was available Saturday, but didn't play.\n\nPresley, held to 65 yards passing in the first half, more than doubled his total on Appalachian State's second scoring drive of the second half, capped by a 17-yard strike to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234138\">Ben Jorden</a> for a 21-10 lead.\n\nPresley scored Appalachian State's first two touchdowns, on 6-yard runs in each half, and added a third on a 30-yard run in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Catamounts' last win in the series, dubbed the Battle for the Old Mountain Jug, came in 2004. Appalachian State has won 26 of 33 games since the jug's introduction in 1976. Appalachian State won last season's game 71-35.\n\nAdrian McLeod made two big plays to stop Appalachian State and allow the Catamounts to take a 10-7 lead.\n\nMcLeod first stopped <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=180793\">Trey Hennessee</a> for a 1-yard loss on fourth-and-goal from the Catamounts' 5.\n\nThen, McLeod tipped a pass attempt from Presley, which Mitchell Bell intercepted at midfield. It led to Blake Bostic's 43-yard field goal late in the first half and a 10-7 lead.\n\nWestern Carolina's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=238546\">Zack Jaynes</a> scored on a 1-yard run in the first quarter for a 7-0 lead. Jaynes was 5-for-26 for 63 yards and was sacked five times."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
