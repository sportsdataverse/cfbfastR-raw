href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173101\">Ben Widmyer</a> scored on a 1-yard run in overtime to lift Wofford to a 38-37 win over Georgia Southern on Saturday night.\n\nThe Terriers (3-1, 1-0 Southern Conference), who never trailed, scored first in overtime and secured the victory after the Eagles (2-3, 0-2) failed on a two point conversion attempt.\n\nFollowing Wofford's score, the Eagles countered with a 25-yard run by freshman <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=387142\">Adam Urbano</a>. Georgia Southern coach Chris Hatcher elected to go for the win, and came up short when quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=238422\">Lee Chapple</a> was sacked by Wofford free safety Jason Leventis.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173094\">Dane Romero</a> ran for 118 yards on 28 carries and three touchdowns for Wofford. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173069\">Fenn Allen</a> caught five passes for 98 yards, while <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173097\">Andy Strickland</a> had 89 yards receiving on five catches.\n\nThe Terriers took a 14-0 lead on Romero's 7-yard touchdown run and after linebacker Seth Goldwire returned an interception 35-yards for a score.\n\nChapple had touchdown passes of 35 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171298\">Tim Camp</a> and 58 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=387143\">Demarcus Watts</a> in the first half, but the Terriers countered with a 39 yard field goal by Patrick Mugan and a pair of touchdown runs by Dane Romero for a 31-14 halftime lead.\n\nRomero?s second touchdown was from 1-yard away with 31 seconds remaining in the second quarter.\n\nGeorgia Southern got back into the game when defensive end Dakota Walker returned a fumble 78 yards for a touchdown and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188307\">Antonio Henton</a> scored from the one.\n\nAdrian Mora kicked a 25 yard field goal with 6 seconds to play to send the game into overtime. Georgia Southern drove 89 yards to set up Mora?s kick after stopping Wofford on downs at the one."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
