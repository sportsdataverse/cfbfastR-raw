href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161330\">Corey Lewis</a> scored three touchdowns and Northern Iowa clinched at least a tie for the Missouri Valley Conference championship with a 28-0 victory over Indiana State on Saturday.\n\nIt was the Sycamores' 25th straight loss over three seasons and the eighth time this year they failed to score a touchdown.\n\nHeavy rain and wind forced both teams to rely mainly on their running games, and the Panthers (9-2, 7-1 Missouri Valley) totaled 238 yards rushing to just 106 yards by the Sycamores (0-11, 0-7), who managed only six first downs all game.\n\nNorthern scored its first touchdown on a 3-yard run by Derek Law with a half-minute left in the opening quarter following a short Indiana State punt into a a strong wind. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236623\">Josh Collins</a> returned the punt to the 27, and it took five plays for the Panthers to score.\n\nNorthern Iowa added two more touchdowns in the second quarter on a 3-yard run by Lewis and a 21-yard reception by Lewis from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236624\">Zach Davis</a>.\n\nAfter a scoreless third quarter, a 52-yard pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172077\">Pat Grace</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=385472\">Jarred Herring</a> set up the third TD by Lewis, a 1-yard run, early in the final period.\n\nLewis finished with 78 yards on 19 carries, while Law had 89 yards on 17 runs.\n\nDavis was 6-of-11 for 111 yards passing, while Indiana State's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185784\">Ryan Roberts</a> was 3-of-7 for 19 yards and one
