(AP) -- Red-shirt sophomore quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186250\">Dale Fink</a> threw for two touchdowns and ran for a third as Sacred Heart defeated Bentley 21-10 on Saturday.\n\nBentley lost the ball five times, including a fumble on a sack that set the stage for Sacred Heart's first touchdown.\n\nMike Mortali returned the fumble for 39 yards and on the next play, Fink threw a swing pass to freshman <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=384157\">Garry Coles</a>, who took it down the right sideline for the touchdown.\n\nTyler McNamara got Bentley on the scoreboard with his 21st career field goal at 6:02 left in the third.\n\nSacred Heart (2-0) soon answered with another touchdown, then extended the lead to 18 about four minutes into the fourth as Fink finished a nine-play, 80-yard drive by taking it in himself from 13 yards out.\n\nBentley's only touchdown came with 5:52 left in the game when sophomore Greg O'Brien blocked a punt and freshman Steve Hopkins took it in for the score.\n\nSenior quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=379210\">John White</a> was sacked six times, throwing for 330 yards and completing 27 of 50 passes for Bentley (1-1).\n\nFink completed 14 of 27 passes for 214 yards for Sacred Heart, and senior tailback <a
