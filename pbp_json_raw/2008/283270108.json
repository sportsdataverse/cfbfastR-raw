href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233508\">Gino Gordon</a> ran for 177 yards and a touchdown Saturday to lead Harvard to a 10-0 win over Yale and a share of the Ivy League championship.\n\nHarvard is co-champion with Brown, which beat Columbia on Saturday. It's the 13th time Harvard has won at least a share of the title.\n\nIn the 125th edition of \"The Game,\" Harvard ground out 261 yards rushing as temperatures in the 20's, wind gusts up to 35 mph and a wind chill near zero stalled its passing attack. Quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162747\">Chris Pizzotti</a> threw for just 109 yards, though he added another 83 yards rushing.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=181074\">Mike McLeod</a> had 65 yards on 21 carries for Yale.\n\nHarvard (9-1, 6-1 Ivy League) scored on a 3-yard run by Gordon in the first quarter after a Harvard punt hit a Yale player and Harvard recovered at the Yale 13. A 23-yard field goal by Patrick Long in the fourth quarter made it 10-0.\n\nHarvard limited Yale (6-4, 4-3) to just five first downs and 90 yards in offense. Yale fumbled three times and missed a 20-yard field goal.\n\nHarvard stopped Yale twice inside the Harvard 5, the second time in the final minutes of the game after Yale picked up a first down at the Harvard 2. Eric Schultz sacked <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233539\">Brook Hart</a>, whose fumble at the Harvard 13 was recovered by Carl
