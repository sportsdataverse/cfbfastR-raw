href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=176532\">Timmy Holloman</a> scored on a 1-yard touchdown to lift Southeast Missouri to a 33-30 win over Austin Peay on Saturday.\n\nAustin Peay (2-8, 2-5 Ohio Valley Conference) led 30-26 when it punted with 4:11 left in the fourth quarter. The Redhawks (4-8, 2-6) used the rest of the time as Holloman was denied at the goal line three times before scoring the game-winning touchdown on fourth down.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=379454\">Matt Scheible</a> connected with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236469\">Chante Ahamefule</a> on a 27-yard touchdown pass to give Southeast Missouri a 30-26 lead in the fourth quarter. The extra point was missed.\n\nScheible completed 12 of 14 passes for 195 yards and three touchdowns. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190884\">Walter Peoples</a> had three catches -- two for scores -- for 81 yards.\n\nThe Governors evened the score on a <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234415\">Trent Caffee</a> 1-yard scramble and took a lead after blocked punt returned for a touchdown followed by a 41-yard field goal by Issac Ziolkowski. Austin Peay held that lead, matching the Redhawks score-for-score, until the game's final seconds.\n\nCaffee threw for 118 yards and a touchdown, as well as rushing for a score. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234423\">Ryan White</a> carried the ball 19 times for 80 yards, while <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187236\">Jeff Lyle</a> caught the Govs only touchdown pass. Ziolkowski, returning from an injury, kicked a season-high three field goals.\n\nIt was the last game of the season for both teams."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
