His 44 completions of 73 attempts tied Neil Lomax atop PSUs all-time list.\n\nThe attempts broke a Big Sky record but fell short of Lomax's school-record 77 attempts.\n\nLast year as a freshman, he set an NCAA record with nine touchdown passes against Weber State. Hubel's 623 passing yards fell one yard short of the Big Sky record set by Weber State's Jamie Martin set in 1991.\n\nPortland State's wide receiver Mario DAmbrosio tied a school record with 16 catches for 192 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nDAmbrosio had Portland State's first two scores, a four-yard touchdown reception early in the first quarter and a six-yarder early in the second period. In between, the visiting Eagles scored twice to take their only lead.\n\nThe Eagles' first score came on Toke Kefus' one-yard run one play after Portland State botched a punt attempt. On its next possession, Eastern Washington moved 80 yards in five plays, capped by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173583\">Dale Morris</a> three-yard scoring run.\n\nAfter a tying touchdown by DAmbrosio, the Vikings took the lead for good, at 17-14, on Danny Urrego's 21-yard field goal. Three minutes later, Urrego added a 42-yard field goal to make it 20-14.\n\nPortland State seemed in charge with a 37-21 lead early in the fourth quarter. But the Eagles' quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171156\">Matt Nichols</a> found receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171140\">Aaron Boyce</a> in the back of the end zone with 7:21 left in the game. Matt Martins two-point reception trimmed Portland State's lead to 37-29.\n\nAfter a three-and-out series by the Vikings, Eastern Washington turned the ball over when Boyce fumbled a reception into the hands of Portland State defensive back Aaron Dickson.\n\nA short time later, Hubel found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=235306\">Aaron Woods</a> behind the coverage for a 43-yard touchdown pass that pushed Portland States lead to 44-29.\n\nPortland State had four players with at least 100 yards receiving."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
