162 yards and three touchdowns to lead Elon to a 42-7 win over Chattanooga on Saturday.\n\nThe Phoenix (7-1, 5-0 Southern Conference), who scored 39 unanswered points after falling behind 7-3 early in the second quarter, won their seventh consecutive game, the program's longest win streak since 1981, when Elon was in the NAIA.\n\nThe loss was the sixth in a row for Chattanooga (1-7, 0-4), which had 87 yards of offense after the first quarter but finished with 125. The Mocs' lone touchdown came on a 5-yard pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=180608\">Jare Gault</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=178699\">Clint Woods</a> on the first play of the second quarter.\n\nElon's first six points came on field goals by Andrew Wilcox, who set a
