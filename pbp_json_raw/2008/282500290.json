(AP) -- Quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188307\">Antonio Henton</a> jump-started a sluggish Georgia Southern offense to lead the Eagles to a 34-20 win over Austin Peay on Saturday night.\n\nHenton, a Fort Valley, Ga., sophomore who transferred to Georgia Southern from Ohio State this past summer, scored two touchdowns and passed for another in the fourth quarter to carry the Eagles (1-1) past the Governors (0-2).\n\nAustin Peay led 20-13 after three quarters but turned the ball over on four consecutive series in the fourth period. The Eagles capitalized by scoring on three straight drives to break the game open.\n\nThe win enabled Georgia Southern to snap a three-game losing streak dating back to last season when it lost its final two games. The Eagles lost their opener last week to then-No. 1 Georgia, 45-21.\n\nGeorgia Southern jumped off to a 13-0 lead on 1-yard runs by freshman Adan Urbano and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=387093\">Leander Barney</a> but couldn't sustain the early momentum. The Governors tied it with 24 seconds left in the half when Garry Orr hit Lance Frederick with a 20-yard touchdown pass.\n\nAustin Peay took the second-half kickoff and drove 67 yards to take a 20-13 lead on Orr's 8-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=165939\">Theo Townsend</a>, only to see its offense collapse against a relentless Georgia Southern defense.\n\nHenton, who played three quarters in the Eagles' rotating quarterback system, earned his team a 20-20 tie when he scored on a 4-yard run with 13:56 to play.\n\nThat score came on the first of three straight Governor fumbles. On its next series, Austin Peay turned over the football on its own 38. Six plays later Henton put Georgia Southern ahead for good with a 16-yard run.\n\nThe Governors then fumbled at their own 42, and Henton made them pay as he teamed with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=237290\">Darell Norman</a> on a two-yard scoring pass to set the final score.\n\nHenton had 103 of Georgia Southern's 224 yards rushing, and completed 10-of-16 passes for 68 yards. Chris Covington, the Eagles' All America defensive back candidate, had 11 tackles, one sack and one forced fumble to lead the defensive effort.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187236\">Jeff Lyle</a> had 86 yards rushing to lead the Governors while Orr completed 17-of-29 passes for 169 yards. Austin Peay had only 62 yards offense in the fourth quarter as the three turnovers proved to be too much to overcome."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
