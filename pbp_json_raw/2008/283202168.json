held Dayton to just 75 offensive yards and got an early safety when a longsnap went past Dayton punter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=241683\">Jeff Pechan</a> and through the end zone.\n\nThe Flyers (9-2, 6-1) managed a 13-2 halftime lead after <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=164022\">Ben Shappie</a> ran for a 10 yard touchdown and Kevin Burns blocked a punt and returned it 20 yards for a TD.\n\nMorehead State also struggled on offense, gaining just 144 yards and pulling starting quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=244247\">Jared Phillips</a> after he failed to complete any of his 10 passes. But the Eagles recovered a Dayton fumble deep in Flyers territory in the third quarter, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187755\">Jerrod Pendleton</a> scored several plays later on a one yard run.\n\nFeldman's go-ahead touchdown came with 5:46 remaining. Dayton, which couldn't score on two ensuing drives, had their 12 game conference winning streak snapped."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
