The Salukis rolled to a 20-0 lead late in the first half and then self-destructed.\n\nThe Bison drove 80 yards in 15 plays for the go-ahead score early in the fourth quarter. The drive was capped by an 11-yard touchdown pass by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=175017\">Nick Mertens</a>, whose toss into traffic was tipped into the air and corralled by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=175023\">Jordan Schultenover</a> in the end zone.\n\nThe Salukis (2-2, 1-1) piled up 206 yards of total offense in the first half, with no turnovers and only two penalties. They stumbled to just 125 total yards in the second half, with two turnovers and 10 penalties.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187992\">Chris Dieker</a> threw a pair of touchdown passes for the Salukis, including a 12-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=176618\">Bryce Morris</a> to give the visitors a 20-0 lead late in the second quarter. The Bison began their comeback with a 9-yard touchdown pass from Mertens to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161984\">Jerimiah Wurzbacher</a>, 36 seconds before
