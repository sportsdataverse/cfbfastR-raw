Since WSU defeated Montana earlier in the season the Wildcats get the league's automatic spot in the FCS playoffs.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=177143\">Trevyn Smith</a> scored all four of Weber State's touchdowns against Eastern Washington, including three on the ground and one reception. He rushed for 171 yards and caught six passes for 60 yards.\n\nSmith's fourth touchdown, a 56-yard run on the final play of the third quarter, pulled the Wildcats to within 33-26. But the Eagles' defense stopped the Wildcats from tying the game in the final minute when Greg Peach recovered a fumble by Smith on EWU's 18-yard line with 57 seconds remaining.\n\nWSU quarterback <a
