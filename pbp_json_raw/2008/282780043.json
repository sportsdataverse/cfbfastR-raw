31-28 overtime victory over Holy Cross Saturday after the Crusaders scored two touchdowns in the final 3:47 of regulation to force the extra session.\n\nHoly Cross quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=178713\">Dominic Randolph</a>, completing a school-record 41 passes, led the Crusaders on touchdown drives of 91 and 90 yards in the closing minutes to eliminate Yale's fourth-quarter 14-point lead. He completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=189023\">Nick Cole</a> on Holy Cross's first possession in overtime to give the Crusaders (1-3) a 28-21 lead.\n\nYale answered on its first overtime possession when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=184456\">Ryan Fodor</a> completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233536\">Jordan Forney</a>.\n\nAfter Yale's next overtime possession stalled at the Holy Cross 20-yard line, Mante kicked his field goal that put the Bulldogs (2-1) back in front. His kick proved to be the game winner when Matt Partain's 37-yard field goal attempt was wide.\n\nPaul Rice's fumble recovery at the Holy Cross 36 yard line late in the first quarter led to Yale's first touchdown, Fodor's 18-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191807\">John Sheffield</a>.\n\nThe Bulldogs increased their lead to 14-0 in the second quarter when Yale captain Bobby Abare intercepted his second pass of the game and returned it 32 yards for his third career touchdown.\n\nHoly Cross answered less than two minutes later with a 72-yard drive, scoring on Randolph's 28-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171553\">Ryan McGuire</a>.\n\nFodor then led Yale on a long 17-play, 71-yard drive of its own, scoring on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=181074\">Mike McLeod</a>'s one-yard touchdown run for a 21-7 lead at the half. McLeod finished with 39 carries for 131 yards.\n\nThe Crusaders' best scoring opportunity in the third quarter ended when Yale tackle Tom McCarthy blocked Partain's 46-yard field goal attempt.\n\nThe Bulldogs, meanwhile, were in Holy Cross territory on three different occasions in the quarter but failed to capitalize, never advancing beyond the 32 yard line.\n\nWhen a Yale drive stalled on downs at the Holy Cross 43 early in the fourth quarter, the Crusaders then marched 91 yards in 24 plays for their second touchdown, Randolph's one-yard run with 3:47 to play.\n\nHoly Cross didn't gain possession again until there only 56 seconds left, and it drove nearly the length of the field again to score the game-tying touchdown that forced overtime.\n\nRandolph finished with 376 yards passing on 63 attempts and was intercepted three times."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
