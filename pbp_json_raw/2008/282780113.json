A few minutes later, Miles picked off a <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=174008\">Robby Schoenhoft</a> pass and returned it 52 yards to get Massachusetts in a more comfortable zone.\n\nDelaware (2-3, 0-1 CAA) got it's only score in a long first quarter drive when Schoenhoft passed 8 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=163196\">Robbie Agnone</a>.\n\nUMass took the 7-0 lead following the opening kickoff on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=157911\">Liam Coen</a>'s 40-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=175915\">Jeremy Horne</a>.\n\nUMass saw a couple of chances of breaking the tie in the first half foiled. A second-quarter pass by Coen was intercepted in the end zone by Fred Andrew. And with five seconds left in the half, Armando Cuko's 45-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left.\n\nThe Minutemen compiled 301 yards in total offense in the first half, compared to 104 for Delaware.
