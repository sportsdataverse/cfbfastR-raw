href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190009\">Armanti Edwards</a> threw two fourth-quarter touchdowns and Appalachian State rallied to beat Furman 26-14 on Saturday.\n\nEdwards finished with 186 yards passing on 16-of-24 completions, including TD passes of 17 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234138\">Ben Jorden</a> and 15 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=180781\">T.J. Courman</a> as the defending Football Championship Subdivision champion Mountaineers (6-2, 4-0 Southern Conference) won their fifth straight game.\n\nEdwards also scored on a 14-yard run and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185951\">Josh Jackson</a> had a 4-yard TD run in the first half as Appalachian State overcame a sluggish offense to take a 13-7 lead.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=380123\">Tersoo Uhaa</a> ran for two touchdowns for the Paladins (6-3, 3-2), who led 14-13 early in the fourth quarter despite losing two first-half scoring chances because of turnovers inside the Mountaineers' 20-yard line.\n\nAfter Edwards' TD run on Appalachian State's opening possession, Furman had a chance to take the lead late in the quarter, driving to the Mountaineers 15. But on the next play, Paladins back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233303\">Sederrik Cunningham</a> had the ball knocked loose at the 1-yard line.\n\nAppalachian State then drove the ball 99 yards in six plays -- keyed by an 84-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=183570\">Devin Radford</a> -- with Jackson's 4-yard run with 13:22 left giving Appalachian State a 13-0 lead.\n\nThe Paladins broke the shutout on its next possession, driving 81 yards before Uhaa scored on a 4-yard run with seven minutes remaining to cut the Mountaineers' lead to six points.\n\nFurman lost a chance to tie the score with another fumble inside the Mountaineers red zone, this one by Uhaa at the Appalachian State 14 with 1:25 left in the first half.\n\nHowever, the Paladins took advantage of a Mountaineers turnover -- a bad snap late in the third quarter -- set up Uhaa's second touchdown, a 2-yard run with 14:20 remaining that put Furman ahead 14-13."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"East
