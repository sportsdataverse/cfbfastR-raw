quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185235\">Vinny Esposito</a> completed 15 of 25 passes for 141 yards, with one interception.\n\nJacksonville's <a

York. Temperatures were in the low 30s, but eight mile-per-hour winds made it feel like it was in the low 20s.\n\nMcGregor completed 10 of 25 passes for 113 yards with one interception, though Albany defenders dropped at least two others.\n\nThe Great Danes (9-3), the Northeast Conference champions, also held Rudell Smith to 46 yards in 16 carries.\n\nThe Dolphins were plagued by poor field position, starting four drives inside their 10-yard line. Their deepest penetration was to the Albany 18 late in the first half, but running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=381063\">J.J.
