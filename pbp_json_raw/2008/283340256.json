Wofford in the first round of the Football Championship Subdivision playoffs on Saturday.\n\nLanders scored the eventual game-winning touchdown on a 6-yard run with 3:21 remaining in the game after throwing scoring passes of 15, 27 and 23 yards as the Dukes (11-1) built a 28-14 halftime lead.\n\nJames Madison advanced to play Villanova (10-2) in the quarterfinals next Saturday. Villanova defeated Colgate 55-28 in the first round.\n\nWofford (9-3) kept pace with the Dukes behind <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234595\">Mike Rucker</a>, who had 11 carries for 107 yards and a touchdown; <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173101\">Ben Widmyer</a>, who rushed for 98 yards, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173094\">Dane Romero</a>, who had 25 carries for 87 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nRomero's fourth score -- a 1-yard run with 1:11 remaining in the third quarter -- tied the score at 28.\n\nHowever, James Madison's Dave Stannard kicked a 24-yard field goal with 11:39 remaining in the game for a 31-28 lead and Landers ran for a score to build a 38-28 advantage with 3:21 left.\n\nRucker's touchdown cut the lead to 38-35 with 1:02 left in the game, but the Dukes recovered the onside kick to run out the clock.\n\nJames Madison rushed for 343 yards and Wofford rolled up 301 yards on the ground.\n\nLanders was 8 of 15 for 126 yards, throwing two touchdown passes to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186145\">Rockeed McCarter</a> and one to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171943\">Bosco Williams</a>.\n\nWidmyer was 8 of 14 for 94
