They advanced to the national title game for the first time.\n\nThe Big Sky Conference co-champions will play the winner of Saturday's contest between Georgia Southern (10-4) and Delaware (11-2) on Jan. 7 in Frisco, Texas.\n\n<inline1>\n\n\"It's awesome,\" said linebacker J.C. Sherritt. \"Getting a win in front of our home crowd, all those people that worked so hard to get us that turf, it's great.\"\n\nVillanova (9-5), the defending national champions, lost four fumbles, each leading to EWU scores.\n\n\"It was the turnovers that really killed us,\" said Villanova coach Andy Talley. \"We obviously didn't bring our 'A' game tonight.\"\n\nMitchell, who transferred to Eastern this season after losing the starting job at SMU, completed 27 of 38 passes for 292 yards and was not intercepted.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to going back and playing in some warm weather,\" said Mitchell, a Texas native.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=484600\" target=\"_new\">Brandon Kaufman</a> caught eight passes for 135 yards. The Eagles were without leading rusher <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233336\" target=\"_new\">Taiwan Jones</a>, who gained 1,742 yards before suffering a broken foot against North Dakota State last weekend. Freshman <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=498080\" target=\"_new\">Mario Brown</a> ran for 104 yards.\n\nVillanova was held to 230 yards of offense and committed six turnovers. Quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234108\" target=\"_new\">Chris Whitney</a> completed just 12 of 21 passes for 95 yards and was intercepted twice.\n\nAnother fumble cost the Wildcats dearly when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191305\" target=\"_new\">Angelo Babbaro</a> was stripped of the ball deep in Villanova territory. Tyler Washburn caught it and ran 15 yards into the end zone for a 34-24 Eastern lead with 13:56 left.\n\nEastern's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=484613\" target=\"_new\">Alante Wright</a> fumbled a punt return, and Babbaro recovered at the Eagles' 14. Whitney ran it in from the 2 to bring Villanova within 34-31 with 7:08 left.\n\nThe Eagles burned up six minutes on their subsequent drive, which ended on fourth-and-4, when Mitchell threw a 23-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=484594\" target=\"_new\">Greg Herd</a> in the end zone.\n\nIn the first half, the Wildcats had the ball for just 10 minutes.\n\n\"That killed us,\" Whitley said.\n\nBabbaro returned the opening kickoff 86 yards for a touchdown and a 7-0 lead. But Mitchell hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=484586\" target=\"_new\">Nicholas Edwards</a> for a 31-yard touchdown pass on EWU's ensuing possession to tie the game.\n\nVillanova then fumbled the ball away three times on its next four possessions, after losing only 11 fumbles all season, to enable Eastern to take a 20-7 lead.\n\nWhitney fumbled on the Wildcats' first play from scrimmage, and Eastern's Paul Ena recovered. The Eagles drove to the 6 before Mike Jarrett kicked a 24-yard field goal for a 10-7 lead.\n\nVillanova fumbled on its next series, the second fumble in only five plays from scrimmage, and Ena recovered again. Jarrett's 31-yard field goal gave Eastern a 13-7 lead.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234103\" target=\"_new\">Matt Szczur</a> fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and EWU's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187496\" target=\"_new\">Matt Johnson</a> recovered.
