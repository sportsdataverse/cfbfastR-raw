topped Gardner-Webb 28-10 Saturday for their fourth-straight home win.\n\nCharleston Southern (5-5, 3-2 Big South Conference) entered halftime tied 7-all and fell behind 10-7 after Gardner-Webb converted a field goal.\n\nAfter forcing a punt at the end of the third quarter, Charleston Southern opened the fourth quarter with a three-play, 85-yard drive to take a 14-10 lead.\n\nDixon capped the drive with a 69-yard touchdown run.\n\nGardner-Webb (2-8, 1-4) attempted to rally but <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/502467/lucas-beatty\" target=\"_new\">Lucas Beatty</a> turned the ball over on back-to-back Bulldog possessions.\n\nCharleston Southern took advantage of those turnovers, as Dixon scored on a 15-yard run following Beatty's first interception and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/498331/teddy-allen\" target=\"_new\">Teddy Allen</a> ran one in from 31 yards after Beatty's second.\n\nAllen finished with 107 yards on
