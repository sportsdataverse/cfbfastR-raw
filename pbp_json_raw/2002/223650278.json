(AP) -- Rodney Davis' phone rang in the locker\nroom just before Fresno State took the field for the Silicon Valley\nClassic.\n\n\t   It was his brother and teammate, calling to wish the Bulldogs\ngood luck. Starting receiver Marque Davis was at home, one of seven\nplayers who couldn't participate because of academic problems.\n\n<photo1>\n\n\t   So Rodney Davis ran for them. He carried 37 times for 153 yards\nand two touchdowns as Fresno State won its first bowl game in 10\nyears, defeating Georgia Tech 30-21 on Tuesday.\n\n\t   \"This win was for the guys who couldn't make it,'' Davis said.\n\n\t   The Bulldogs (9-5) had not won a postseason game since beating\nSouthern California in the 1992 Freedom Bowl, a string of four\nstraight losses.\n\n\t   And they were even more proud they did it with a depleted\nroster. Fresno State suited only 45 players, and was missing five\nstarters.\n\n\t   A new Western Athletic Conference rule requires athletes to pass\nat least six credits to play in a bowl game, and seven didn't meet\nthe requirement. They may have had incompletes or grades that had\nnot yet been finalized, for example.\n\n\t   \"For the nation to think we played with ineligible players is a\nmisconception,'' coach Pat Hill said. \"We were playing with\nnon-certified players. ... I'm so proud of this football team. We\nhad some adversity this season.''\n\n\t   Three seniors stayed home, some because their grades weren't\nposted.\n\n\t   \"That drives me nuts,'' Hill said. \"But we persevered.''\n\n\t   Asen Asparuhov kicked a 33-yard field goal with 3:43 left, one\nof his three in the game, and Davis clinched the victory with a\n28-yard TD run just more than a minute later for the Bulldogs.\n\n\t   And the Fresno State defense did an impressive job after\nhalftime of weathering a strong second-half comeback attempt by\nGeorgia Tech freshman backup quarterback Damarius Bilbo.\n\n\t   Bilbo passed for a touchdown and ran for another after replacing\nthe ineffective A.J. Suggs, but Bilbo also threw four interceptions\nas the Yellow Jackets (7-6) committed seven turnovers.\n\n\t   Georgia Tech was the only team in the ACC to throw more\ninterceptions (14) than touchdowns (13) this season.\n\n\t   \"I'm disappointed with the execution,'' coach Chan Gailey said.\n\"Obviously, you have to be able to stop the run and you have to be\nable to execute on offense, and we didn't do either well.''\n\n\t   The game turned into a muddy mess after hard rain fell Monday\nnight. It took only a few plays for Georgia Tech's gleaming white\nuniforms to turn a dull brown, and there were plenty of slips and\nmissed plays.\n\n\t   In a lackluster first half, the teams struggled to take\nadvantage of their scoring opportunities, with Fresno State leading\n13-7 at halftime.\n\n\t   Dee Meza's 48-yard interception return for a touchdown with 14\nseconds left in the second quarter highlighted the half.\n\n\t   Fresno State was playing in the Silicon Valley Classic for the\nthird straight year, and Bulldogs fans took up the majority of the\nseats at Spartan Stadium.\n\n\t   Georgia Tech was trying to protect the nation's top bowl record\nin its sixth straight postseason appearance, and the Yellow Jackets\nthought their chances were good with Fresno State missing so many\nkey players.\n\n\t   \"We really thought that we could go out and our game plan would\nwork even better,'' Bilbo said.\n\n\t   Georgia Tech is now 20-11 after coming into the game tied with\nPenn State for a .667 bowl winning percentage.\n\n\t   Yellow Jackets placekicker Luke Manget made three extra points\nto give him 160 straight PATs, one shy of the NCAA record for\nconsecutive extra points of 161, set by John Becksvoort of\nTennessee from 1991-94.\n\n\t   \n\n"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Atlantic Coast Conference -
