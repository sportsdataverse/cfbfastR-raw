(AP) -- Texas Christian figured out how to stop\nColorado State standout Cecil Sapp after just two runs in the\nAXA Liberty Bowl.\n\n\t   Sapp reeled off big gains of 59 and 25 yards on the Rams' first\ntwo possessions, and the Horned Frogs -- who rank first in the\nnation against the run -- knew something had to change.\n\n\t   Sapp had 22 yards the rest of the game, and TCU tailback Ricky\nMadison stole the show with 111 yards rushing and a touchdown as\nthe Horned Frogs beat Colorado State (No. 21 ESPN/USA Today, No. 23 AP) 17-3 on Tuesday.\n\n\t   \"We were a little anxious, moving too fast,'' linebacker\nLaMarcus McDonald said. \"We were trying to get there before the\nplay developed. We had to slow down and catch the tempo.''\n\n\t   It was the Horned Frogs' 500th victory in school history.\n\n\t   Madison ran for 107 of his yards in the rainy second half as\nTCU's offense came alive after a sloppy opening by both teams.\n\n\t   In the first half, the teams combined for three lost fumbles,\ntwo interceptions, a missed field goal and an unsuccessful faked\nfield goal. Their sloppy play made for the lowest scoring first\nhalf of a Liberty Bowl since Penn State led Tulane 6-0 in 1979.\n\n\t   TCU (10-2) finally put together a seven-play, 62-yard scoring\ndrive led by Lonta Hobbs in the closing minutes of the second\nquarter. The freshman ran for 39 yards in the drive, capped when\nSean Stilley threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to LaTarence Dunbar\nwith 1:21 remaining to put TCU up 7-0 at the break.\n\n\t   Colorado State (10-4) countered quickly in the third quarter\nwith a 46-yard field goal by Jeff Babcock at 11:22. The score --\nwhich tied Babcock's career long -- came on a four-play drive for\nnegative-6 yards.\n\n\t   \"I thought it was a big key at the start of the second half\nwhen they had the punt return down there and we held them to a\nfield goal,'' TCU coach Gary Patterson said.\n\n\t   The Rams had another opportunity for points on their next\npossession, when short back-to-back runs by Sapp brought them to\nthe TCU 22. But two penalties and a play for negative yardage\npushed them back to the 38, and they had to punt.\n\n\t   The Rams were held to 89 yards rushing -- compared with 197 for\nTCU -- for their lowest total of the season. TCU also outgained\nColorado State 338-149.\n\n\t   \"They are one hell of a defense, they are very athletic. I've\ngot to respect them because of what they've done all year,'' Sapp\nsaid.\n\n\t   TCU added cushion in the fourth when Nick Browne scored on a\n25-yard field goal with 6:57 remaining. Madison then scored just\nover three minutes after the field goal for the final margin.\n\n\t   Sapp's first run -- the longest allowed by TCU from scrimmage\nthis season -- brought Colorado State to the TCU 11, but the Rams\ncouldn't capitalize. Though they set up for a field goal, they\ninstead attempted a fake with holder Joey Cuppari passing to an\nopen Brandon Alconcel in the end zone. But Alconcel dropped the\npass.\n\n\t   \"The first big run they had was my fault. I called a blitz, and\nas he has done all year, Cecil Sapp hit the seam and took off to\nthe races,'' Patterson said. \"We adjusted a couple of things to\nmake sure'' that didn't happen again.\n\n\t   Sapp finished with 106 yards -- although 84 of them came on those\nfirst two runs. Despite that, the total gives him his ninth\n100-yard game of the season, tying a school record set by Steve\nBartalo in 1986."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
