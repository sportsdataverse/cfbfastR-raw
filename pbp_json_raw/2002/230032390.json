(AP) -- For three quarters, the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl was a\nperfectly good, if not memorable, college football championship\ngame.\n\n\t   By the end of the fourth quarter, with Ohio State and Miami tied\nat 17, it was a classic.\n\n<photo1>\n\n\t   After two overtimes, and the Buckeyes' 31-24 victory, it was one\nof the greatest ever.\n\n\t   \"It was just like two great heavyweights slugging it out,''\nwinning coach Jim Tressel said Friday night.\n\n\t   No one wanted to be No. 2.\n\n\t   In a shocking, thrilling season-ender, Ohio State ripped the\nnational title from the confident 'Canes -- who, at one point,\nrushed onto the field thinking they had won.\n\n\t   That's the kind of game it was.\n\n\t   It changed minute by minute, down by down.\n\n\t   In the end, Maurice Clarett ran 5 yards for the winning\ntouchdown, and Ohio State's defense turned back one final bid by\nNo. 1 Miami to tie it. With that, the Buckeyes completed an\nunlikely, unbeaten run to their first national title in 34 years.\n\n\t   The second-ranked Buckeyes, 11½-point underdogs, ended the\nHurricanes' try for a second straight title and their winning\nstreak at 34.\n\n\t   \"It's no different than what we've done all year,'' Ohio State\nquarterback Craig Krenzel said. \"We make plays in the big games\nwhen we have to.''\n\n\t   But it would have never happened if not for a late pass\ninterference call at the end of the first overtime.\n\n\t   Instead, the fourth-down call gave Ohio State the chance it\nneeded to tie the game and send it into the second overtime.\n\n\t   By then, it already was an all-timer -- the first national\nchampionship game to go into overtime, in a matchup of the nation's\nlast two undefeated teams, both fighting staying to stay perfect.\n\n\t   The greatest game ever?\n\n\t   \"It's got to be right up there if it's not,'' Krenzel said.\n\n\t   Miami's Todd Sievers sent the game into overtime with his\n40-yard field goal on the final play of the fourth quarter.\n\n\t   The Buckeyes' punishing defense had rattled and pounded Miami\nquarterback Ken Dorsey all night.\n\n\t   And on the last play of the game, on fourth-and-goal at the 1,\nCie Grant blitzed and forced Dorsey to heave a desperation pass\nthat linebacker Matt Wilhelm batted to the ground.\n\n\t   A few plays earlier, Wilhelm hit Dorsey with such force it sent\nthe quarterback to the sideline for one play. He came back in, but\nthe Buckeyes would not be denied against a team trying to secure\nits place in history as one of college football's great dynasties.\n\n\t   \"It feels unreal,'' Miami fullback Quadtrine Hill said. \"After\nthe game was over, it felt like we had one play left. It can't be\nover. It's something I never want to feel again.''\n\n\t   While Miami coach Larry Coker lost for the first time in 25\ngames, Tressel now has a major college title to add to the four he\nwon in Division I-AA at Youngstown State.\n\n\t   Nine times since Woody Hayes coached the Buckeyes to the 1968\ntitle, Ohio State lost a late-season game that cost it a possible\nchampionship. But the Buckeyes finally brought the title back to\nColumbus with a conservative offense and fierce defense that Hayes\nwould have loved.\n\n\t   The fantastic finish was nothing new for Ohio State this season.\nThe Buckeyes won six games by seven points or fewer, including\ntheir last three to make it to the title game -- 10-6 over Purdue,\n23-16 over Illinois in overtime and 14-9 over Michigan.\n\n\t   Miami (12-1) nearly had its 35th straight victory in the first\novertime after scoring a touchdown on its first possession.\n\n\t   Trailing 24-17, Ohio State (14-0) converted a fourth-and-14 on a\npass by Krenzel. But the Buckeyes then faced a fourth-and-3 at the\n5 when Krenzel threw to the right corner of the end zone for Chris\nGamble, who was being covered Glenn Sharpe.\n\n\t   As Gamble reached back for the ball, he got his hands on it but\ncouldn't hold on. Seconds later, field judge Terry Porter threw a\nflag from the back of the end zone indicating pass interference\neven as Miami players and fans spilled onto the field.\n\n\t   \"He was holding me. He was in my facemask and my shoulder\npads,'' Gamble said. \"I was waiting for the flag, but he kind of\nhesitated. I didn't see him going for the flag and I thought, `He\nain't going to throw it.' Luckily, he did, and I'm like, `whew.'''\n\n\t   Porter said: \"I saw the guy holding the guy prior to the ball\nbeing in the air. He was still holding him, pulling him down while\nthe ball was in the air.''\n\n\t   Order was restored quickly, and three plays later Krenzel scored\nfrom the 1 to send the game to a second OT.\n\n\t   After losing All-American running back Willis McGahee to an\ninjured left knee early in the fourth quarter, Miami had the ball\nfirst in overtime. The Hurricanes went ahead on Dorsey's 7-yard TD\npass to Kellen Winslow Jr., but the Buckeyes answered with\nKrenzel's 1-yard score.\n\n\t   In the second OT, the Buckeyes went first from the 25 and\nClarett capped off a five-play drive with his spinning, slithering\ncutback through the Miami defense.\n\n\t   Dorsey, a Heisman Trophy finalist, finished off his career with\njust his second loss in 40 starts. Even though he was groggy from\nWilhelm's hit, he came back into the game to try and pull the\n'Canes even.\n\n\t   The Associated Press poll of sports writers and broadcasters was\nto be released early Saturday, with the second-ranked Buckeyes a\nlock to move up to No. 1.\n\n\t   Ohio State didn't have to wait to pick up the trophy awarded by\nthe USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, which automatically goes to the\nFiesta winner, this season's designated Bowl Championship Series\ntitle game.\n\n\t   Ohio State led 14-7 at the half, and extended the margin to 10\npoints on Mike Nugent's 44-yard field goal. The 'Canes closed to\n17-14 on McGahee's 9-yard scoring run with 2:11 left in the third\nquarter. And that set the stage for Sievers' kick, leaving the Sun\nDevil Stadium crowd of 77,502 breathless.\n\n\t   When the game ended, players and red-clad Buckeyes fans\nconverged on the field to celebrate their first national title\nsince 1968.\n\n\t   The Buckeyes' ferocious defense had Dorsey in trouble from the\nopening series with two sacks. Although Ohio State fell behind 7-0,\nthe constant pressure paid huge dividends in the second quarter as\nthe Buckeyes took a 14-7 halftime lead, turning two turnovers into\ntouchdowns in a 78-second span.\n\n\t   Ohio State failed to capitalize on Dorsey's first interception --\nan overthrown pass right into the arms of cornerback Dustin Fox\nnear midfield -- but a second led to the Buckeyes' first score.\n\n\t   All-American safety Mike Doss picked off a pass that went off\nthe hands of intended receiver Andre Johnson and raced 35 yards up\nthe right sideline to the Miami 17.\n\n\t   From there, it took seven plays before Krenzel fought his way\ninto the end zone on fourth down from the 1 with 2:28 left in the\nhalf. Two Miami defenders, Roger McIntosh and Jamaal Green, hit\nKrenzel at the 2, but he twisted his way in for the score.\n\n\t   The Buckeyes were back in business on the next play. Dorsey\ndropped back to pass, but defensive tackle Kenny Peterson came\naround from the right side and spun him to the ground as the ball\ncame loose. Darrion Scott recovered at the Miami 14.\n\n\t   Two runs and an offsides call later, Clarett finally broke free\nfor a 7-yard touchdown run with 1:10 left and just like that the\nBuckeyes were ahead, fireworks were shot off and the Buckeyes fans\nrocked the stadium.\n\n\t   Dorsey threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Roscoe Parrish in the\nfirst quarter, thanks to a block by McGahee on blitzing safety\nDonnie Nickey.\n\t   \n\t   \n"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
