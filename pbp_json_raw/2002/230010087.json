(AP) -- A little trickery on offense. A lot of\njarring hits on defense, especially the one that knocked the\nquarterback on his back and out of the game.\n\n<photo1>\n\nThat was all No. 17 North Carolina State needed to dissolve the Irish mystique Wednesday in the Toyota Gator Bowl and state its case as a program on the rise.\n\nLed by quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=105812\">Philip Rivers</a> and a defense that didn't give\nup a touchdown for the second straight game, the Wolfpack (11-3)\nfinished off the best season in school history with a 28-6 victory\nover Notre Dame (No. 12 ESPN/USA Today, No. 11 AP).\n\n\t   \"We had a great season, then we put a stamp on it,'' coach\nChuck Amato said. \"To have (victory) No. 11 be Notre Dame, to win\nback-to-back against Florida State and Notre Dame, two of the best\nprograms in America ... It's hard to do.''\n\n\t   The defense didn't allow a touchdown in the last two games, and\nwhile the trick plays were entertaining Wednesday, it was\nlinebacker Dantonio Burnette who set the tone.\n\n\t   The Irish had second-and-goal from the 1 on their second\npossession of the game when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=107215\">Carlyle Holiday</a> ran right and was\nhammered by Burnette, separating his shoulder.\n\n\t   \"When I hit him I heard him groan, and when I looked down he\nwas still on the ground,'' Burnette said. \"I was like, 'OK, this\nis going to turn the game around now.'''\n\n\t   The Irish had to settle for a field goal, and they never found\nan answer for Rivers and a Wolfpack offense that made them look bad\nfor the second game in a row.\n\n\t   Rivers completed 13 consecutive passes as N.C. State scored\nthree touchdowns in the second quarter, one of them on a\nfumblerooski and another set up by a flea-flicker.\n\n\t   Early in the third quarter, Wolfpack receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=15236\">Bryan Peterson</a> had\nmore passing yards on two trick players (27) than either of the\nIrish quarterbacks.\n\n\t   \"Every game they show you something you haven't seen,'' Notre\nDame safety Glenn Earl said. \"They were able to get us off\nbalance. And they executed well.''\n\n\t   The Irish (10-3) not only lost Holiday, they lost\ntheir temper with three personal fouls and wound up losing their\nsixth consecutive bowl game.\n\n\t   This one put a damper on an otherwise remarkable year.\n\n\t   Coming off a 5-6 season, Notre Dame won its first eight games\nand started thinking about a record ninth national championship.\nInstead, the Irish lost three of their last five games, and the\nlast two were embarrassing.\n\n\t   \"It's still a very good season,'' coach Tyrone Willingham said.\n\"There are not that many 10-win teams in the country. At the same\ntime, we have to become accustomed to winning our last game,\nwhether it's the regular season or a bowl game.''\n\n\t   Notre Dame gave up a school-record 610 yards in a 44-13 loss to\nSouthern California, and a defense determined to show that game was\na fluke looked hapless against the Wolfpack.\n\n\t   N.C. State went 96 and 76 yards on consecutive drives, and there\nwas nothing the Irish could do about it. Notre Dame, which allowed\n145 points in its first 11 games, gave up 72 points in its last\ntwo.\n\n\t   Rivers, bobbing and weaving through the pass rush, was 23-for-37\nfor 228 yards and two touchdowns. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=105849\">Jerricho Cotchery</a> caught 10\npasses for 127 yards.\n\n\t   The Wolfpack defense did its part, hitting harder and with more\npurpose. It finished in style, denying a garbage score in the final\nseconds when Notre Dame had first-and-goal from the 2.\n\n\t   Rod<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=112167\">Johnson</a>, a senior safety who came in with one career\ninterception, had three off Notre Dame backup <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=118917\">Pat Dillingham</a>, all\nin double- and triple-coverage.\n\n\t   The Wolfpack had never won more than 10 games in a season in\ntheir 111-year history, and saw this game -- and this opponent -- as\na chance to start putting their program on the map.\n\n\t   \"It seemed like we were the other team down here all week,''\nBurnette said.\n\n\t   In what looked like sandlot football at times, N.C. State ran\nthree trick plays during one drive.\n\n\t   On the fumblerooski, the linemen were upright and didn't move\neven after the ball was snapped to Rivers, who was in a short,\nshotgun formation. Rivers quickly slipped the ball under the legs\nof <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=134154\">T.A. McLendon</a> in front of him, and the freshman plowed in for a\n3-yard score, his second touchdown.\n\n\t   N.C. State's defense never gave Dillingham much time to throw,\nor many options when he did manage to get the pass off. He threw\ninto double coverage and was intercepted by<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=112167\">Johnson</a> late in the\nsecond quarter.\n\n\t   That led to another Wolfpack touchdown -- set up by another trick\nplay.\n\n\t   Rivers short-hopped a lateral to Bryan Peterson, who scooped it\nup and threw 24 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=105855\">Joseph Gray</a>. There was no one within 15\nyards of the 260-pound tight end, but he fell down catching the\nball.\n\n\t   Three plays later, Rivers found Cotchery for a 9-yard touchdown.\n\n\t   The Irish got inside the 25 three times in the second half, but\nmanaged only a field goal. Their last bowl victory was 24-21\nagainst Texas A&M in the 1994 Cotton Bowl."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
