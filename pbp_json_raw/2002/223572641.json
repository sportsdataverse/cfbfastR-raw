(AP) -- A monthlong layoff and an ankle injury did\nlittle to slow down Kliff Kingsbury.\n\n<photo1>\n\n\t   Kingsbury became the third Division I-A player to top 5,000\nyards passing in a season, throwing for 375 and three touchdowns as\nTexas Tech defeated Clemson 55-15 in the Mazda Tangerine Bowl on Monday\nnight.\n\n\t   ''Five thousand yards, that's a big number,'' Kingsbury said.\n''That shows how well our offense played this season.''\n\n\t   Texas Tech (9-5) won its first bowl game since beating Air Force\nin the 1995 Copper Bowl and gave coach Mike Leach his first\npostseason victory.\n\n\t   Five different receivers caught touchdown passes for the Red\nRaiders, and Wes Welker had a 59-yard punt return for a score.\n\n\t   It was the worst defeat of the season for Clemson (7-6), and the\nworst in a bowl since a 41-0 defeat to Syracuse in the 1996 Gator\nBowl.\n\n\t   ''I'm totally embarrassed,'' defensive tackle Nick Eason said.\n''This was my last game as a Clemson Tiger, and I got destroyed. I\nmight have more games, in the NFL, maybe some All-Star games, but\nthis is one I'll always remember.''\n\n\t   Kingsbury, who was named the game's most valuable player, completed 32 of 43\npasses and finished his career with 5,017 yards. The only other\nplayers to reach the mark are BYU's Ty Detmer, who had 5,188 yards,\nand Houston's David Klingler, who had 5,140. Both players did it in\n1990. Detmer played in 12 games, Klingler 11.\n\n\t   ''I felt like we could do some things, seeing their defensive\nbase package and how they lined up,'' Kingsbury said. ''I felt like\nwe could exploit it.''\n\n\t   Kingsbury left briefly in the third quarter after Clemson\ndefensive end Khaleed Vaughn appeared to roll onto his right leg.\nKingsbury quickly got up, but he hopped only a few yards before\nfalling to the turf and motioning to the training staff. He got his\nankle re-taped and jogged on the sideline without a limp, and he\nreturned on the next possession after approval from the trainer.\n\n\t   ''He wasn't keeping me off the field,'' Kingsbury said. ''I was\ngoing to get back out there.''\n\n\t   The Red Raiders were playing for the first time since a 60-15\ndefeat against Oklahoma on Nov. 23, but they went ahead 3-0 lead after\ntaking their opening possession 82 yards in 13 plays. It was 24-0\nin the second quarter before the Tigers blocked a punt out of the\nend zone for a safety and their first points.\n\n\t   Kingsbury was intercepted once on a poorly thrown pass in the\nfirst quarter, but he had little problems solving Clemson's\ncoverage.\n\n<!---------------------PULL-QUOTE TABLE\n(BEGIN)--------------------->\n<table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=0\nalign=right>\n<tr valign=top>\n<td width=4><spacer type=block width=3\nheight=1></td>\n<td><font face=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\"\nsize=4><b>“</b></font></td>\n<td width=225><font\nface=\"Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\" size=4><b>I'm\ntotally embarrassed.

''I'm proud\nof the way we came down here and stuck to business.''\n\n\t   Charlie Whitehurst, a redshirt freshman who led the Tigers to\nvictories in three of their past four games after taking over as\nthe starting quarterback, couldn't match Kingsbury. He finished\n20-for-48 for 263 yards and four interceptions after being\nintercepted only twice in 166 attempts coming into the game.\n\n\t   Most of Whitehurst's problems were caused by a lack of\nprotection by his offensive line. Even when he avoided a sack he\noften got hit. He left with 2:10 to go after taking a hard hit from\nlinebacker Geremy Woods, although Whitehurst walked off the field\non his own.\n\n\t   ''I honestly felt sorry for Whitehurst,'' Texas Tech defensive\nend Aaron Hunt said. ''We hit him shot after shot after shot. Just\nlike any other freshman, when you hit him, he gets rattled and\nstarts running around and doing crazy things.''\n\n\t   His receivers let him down, too, dropping at least five passes.\nLate in the first half, with Clemson driving, Whitehurst threw a\nperfect pass to Airese Currie at the goal line. But the ball\nbounced off Currie's shoulder pads and landed in the hands of Texas\nTech safety Vincent Meeks with 31 seconds left.\n\n\t   After Meeks returned it 23 yards, three quick passes by\nKingsbury moved the ball into field goal range. Robert Treece\nkicked a 40-yarder on the last play of the half for a 34-2 lead.\n\n\t   ''The score's pretty embarrassing,'' Clemson coach Tommy Bowden\nsaid. ''Games that come down to the end of the fourth quarter,\nthose are a little easier to take.''"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
