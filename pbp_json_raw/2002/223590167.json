She attempted an extra point after\nNew Mexico's first touchdown but the try, which sailed low, was\nblocked.\n\n\t   \"I can replay in my mind seeing that hand block the kick, and\nthat's going to be what I think about before I go to bed tonight,''\nHnida said. \"It's been a very long road to get here and I thought\nabout it many times, but I really had no specific expectations as\nto what it would be like.''\n\n\t   UCLA (8-5) got the big plays and defensive stops it needed in\nthe second half to beat New Mexico, making just its second bowl\nappearance in 41 years.\n\n\t   The Bruins played under Kezirian, who took over the team after\nBob Toledo was fired at the end of the regular season. Toledo was\nreplaced with Karl Dorrell, the wide receivers coach for the Denver\nBroncos, but Dorrell has not yet taken over the team.\n\n\t   \"This game isn't really about me, it's about the players,''\nKezirian said.\n\n\t   Sophomore wide receiver Craig Bragg helped the Bruins win for\ntheir fill-in coach.\n\n\t   His 74-yard punt return early in the third quarter broke a 6-6\ntie. Bragg was recruited by Toledo to be a game-breaker.\n\n\t   \"I take it upon myself to do that and I did it today,'' he\nsaid.\n\n\t   Bragg had seven touchdowns this season of 30 yards or more and\nhas a career average of nearly 42 yards on his touchdowns. He\nfielded the punt at the 26, broke a tackle and raced up the left\nsideline.\n\n\t   \"I thought our miscues on special teams and on offense and the\nbig punt return were obviously the difference in the game,'' New\nMexico coach Rocky Long said.\n\n\t   Long defended his decision to give Hnida a chance.\n\n\t   \"Katie is a valuable member of our team,'' Long said. \"I think\nit's a very unusual situation, and she's put in a position a lot of\ntimes that's very uncomfortable. I made the decision before the\ngame that we were going to let her kick the first extra point.''\n\n\t   Hnida, with her blond hair in a ponytail, attempted the kick\nafter the Lobos took a 6-3 lead on a 55-yard interception return by\nDesmar Black with 8:20 left in the first quarter.\n\n\t   The 5-foot-9, 150-pound Hnida was on the Colorado roster in 1999\nand suited up for the Buffaloes in the Insight.com Bowl. She walked\non to the New Mexico team before this season.\n\n\t   The Bruins put the game away with Bragg's punt return and two\ntouchdowns in the fourth quarter off New Mexico turnovers. Page\nscored one minute into the fourth quarter on a 29-yard return after\nhe picked the ball out of the air off a pass from Casey Kelly that hit\ntight end Zach Cresap in the back.\n\n\t   Freshman halfback Tyler Ebell scored with 10:40 left after New\nMexico's third turnover of the game -- a fumble by wide receiver Joe\nManning that was recovered by linebacker Brandon Chillar at the\nLobos 31.\n\n\t   Bragg's punt return was the Bruins' first for a TD since 1998.\n\n\t   New Mexico (7-7) has played in only seven bowl games since 1939\nand has not won one since 1961.\n\n\t   It showed.\n\n\t   While the Lobos' blitzing and stunting defense held UCLA's\nrushing game to 26 yards in the first half, New Mexico's offense\nstruggled to sustain drives or killed them with penalties.\n\n\t   The Lobos' other score was on an 11-yard pass from Kelly to\nManning in the fourth quarter.\n\n\t   UCLA got first-half field goals of 49 and 39 yards by Nate\nFikse. The first one, with 10:24 left in the first quarter, was set\nup by freshman DonTrell Moore's fumble at the Lobos 21 on New\nMexico's second play from scrimmage.\n\n\t   Moore, who rushed for 1,117 yards this season, ran tentatively\nthe rest of the game and had just 17 yards on 14 carries.\n\n\t   Hnida's failed kick didn't matter as she made her mark just by\ntaking the field.\n\n\t   Heather Sue Mercer earned a spot on the Duke roster as a walk-on\nin 1995 but was cut from the team by then-coach Fred Goldsmith\nbefore the 1996 season.\n\n\t   Stephanie Weimer tried out for Penn State this summer, but\ndidn't make the team. Louisville and Colorado also have had female\nkickers on their rosters.\n\n\t   In 1997, Liz Heaston became the first woman to score in a\ncollege game, kicking two extra points for Willamette, which was\nthen an NAIA school.
