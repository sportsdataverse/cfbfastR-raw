(AP) -- Zack Mills found the perfect medicine for\nhis sprained shoulder.\n\n<photo1>\n\n\t   Mills recovered a fumble by fullback Paul Jefferson at the 1 and\ntumbled into the end zone for a first-quarter touchdown as Penn State (No. 21 ESPN/USA Today, No. 20 AP) earned a 34-31 victory over Wisconsin (No. 15 ESPN/USA Today, No. 19 AP) on Saturday.\n\n\t   Mills landed on his left (throwing) shoulder on the Nittany\nLions' second drive and feared he'd join Badgers' star Lee Evans on\nthe sideline.\n\n\t   \"At first they thought it was separated, but I went in and had\nit checked. They think it's a sprained A.C. joint,'' Mills said.\n\"It was painful when I first when back in.\n\n\t   \"But on the fumble the adrenaline kicked in and I didn't feel\nanything.''\n\n\t   Mills went on to complete 21 of 37 passes for 287 yards. And he\nset a school record with 686 yards passing in consecutive games,\nsurpassing Kerry Collins' mark of 630 set in 1993.\n\n\t   Evans, on the other hand, didn't feel good enough to play\nagainst Penn State (4-1, 1-1 Big Ten).\n\n\t   The Badgers (5-1, 0-1) were hoping to have Evans, the Big Ten's\nleading receiver in 2001, back for their first conference game.\n\n\t   \"I'd be lying if I said a lot of people didn't have one eye on\nit or crammed into the back of their head,'' Badgers quarterback\nBrooks Bollinger said. \"But you can't throw a kid out to the\nwolves with one leg. He'll know when he's healthy and that will be\na happy day.''\n\n\t   Evans injured his left knee in the spring game April 20, but the\nBadgers hadn't really missed him until Saturday, when their\noffensive line couldn't hold off the Nittany Lions' pass rush, and\ntheir group of young receivers made several crucial mistakes in the\nfourth quarter.\n\n\t   Trailing 28-23 with 11:24 left, the Badgers got the ball at the\nPenn State 47, their best field position all afternoon. But\nsophomore Darren Charles had his second drop of the game, then\nfreshman Jonathan Orr let a perfect pass bounce off his chest at\nthe 25 on third down.\n\n\t   \"We've been making those plays,'' Badgers coach Barry Alvarez\nsaid. \"You have to make (those) plays, particularly at crunch\ntime. That was huge.''\n\n\t   The Nittany Lions capitalized by moving 40 yards in seven plays\nfor Robbie Gould's career-long 51-yard field goal that made it\n31-23.\n\n\t   \"We were debating on the sideline what to do,'' coach Joe\nPaterno said. \"He said, 'Coach, I can do it.' So, we let him.''\n\n\t   On the next possession, Bollinger's pass to freshman Brandon\nWilliams was tipped by Anwar Phillips, and linebacker Gino Capone\ncame down with the ball. It was just the second interception of the\nseason for Bollinger.\n\n\t   That led to Gould's fourth field goal, a 40-yarder that made it\nan 11-point game with 2:55 left. The score became critical when the\nBadgers pulled to 34-31 with 1:17 left, as Bollinger hit Orr from\n28 yards out and Dwayne Smith ran in the 2-point conversion.\n\n\t   Nittany Lions linebacker LaMar Stewart recovered the onside kick\nand Penn State ran out the clock.\n\n\t   Alvarez hoped Evans would be able to play.\n\n\t   \"The way he practiced on Tuesday, I thought he was going to\nplay,'' Alvarez said. \"He had some soreness. He practiced again on\nThursday. It didn't clear up the way we wanted it to and he didn't\nfeel comfortable with it.''\n\n\t   Wisconsin pulled to 28-20 when Williams caught a 7-yard\ntouchdown pass in the third quarter, but as senior left tackle Ben\nJohnson rushed to celebrate he ran over a defensive back for a\npenalty that forced Scott Campbell to attempt his conversion kick\nfrom 36 yards, and he missed to the right.\n\n\t   Mike Allen's 48-yard field goal with 13:05 left pulled the\nBadgers within five points.\n\n\t   A year ago, the Badgers controlled the clock for nearly 42\nminutes and rushed for 320 yards in an 18-6 victory at Happy\nValley.\n\n\t   The Nittany Lions dominated this time. Their 145 first-quarter\nyards were 14 more than they totaled against Wisconsin last year,\ntheir lowest output ever under Paterno.\n\n\t   Behind Larry Johnson's 171 all-purpose yards, they outgained the\nBadgers 436-309. Johnson ran 14 times for 111 yards before leaving\nwith a hamstring injury.\n\n\t   The Badgers' only big break came when linebacker Alex Lewis\nslammed Mills and cornerback B.J. Tucker stepped in front of tight\nend Casey Williams and returned an interception 65 yards for a\ntouchdown that gave Wisconsin 14-13 lead.\n\n\t   \"I should have just eaten the ball,'' Mills said. \"But the way\nwe were moving the ball, we had a lot of confidence.''\n\n\t   That faith showed as Penn State needed just four plays to regain\nthe lead for good on Johnson's 24-yard rumble."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
