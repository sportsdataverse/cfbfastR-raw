href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=29436\">Lee Suggs</a> stood in the stadium hallway in cleats and a uniform covered in mud and paint. He posed for pictures, signed autographs and chatted -- anything to keep wearing his Virginia Tech colors for another minute.\n\n<photo1>\n\nSuggs capped his remarkable comeback season by rushing for two more touchdowns, and Ronyell Whitaker forced a fumble near the goal line as time expired to lift No. 21 Virginia Tech to a 20-13 victory Tuesday night over Air Force in the inaugural Diamond Walnut San Francisco Bowl.\n\nSuggs extended his NCAA record by scoring in his 27th straight game, but until Whitaker followed up an exceptional deflection by stopping Air Force quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=127648\">Chance Harridge</a> at the Hokies 4 on the final play, Suggs couldn't breathe easily.\n\nHe knew his comeback following a knee injury that all but wiped out his junior year wouldn't have been complete without the win.\n\n\"I've played with these guys for five years, so not being out there and not putting on that uniform, it's going to be different,'' Suggs said. \"But it's time to move on, I know. This is the way to do it.''\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=116190\">Bryan Randall</a> was 18-of-23 for 177 yards as the Hokies (10-4)\nstuck to a deliberate game plan to grind out a victory over the\nFalcons (8-5). Virginia Tech's swarming defense limited Air Force\nto three points after the game's first 7½ minutes.\n\nHarridge completed just one of his first 13 passes, but he drove\nAir Force to the Virginia Tech 10 with 17 seconds left on a\nfourth-and-10 completion to J.P. Waller.\n\nAfter two incomplete passes, Harridge scrambled for the end\nzone. He was met at the 4 by Whitaker, who forced a game-ending\nfumble.\n\n\"If you've got Air Force where they've got to throw, you feel\nlike you've got them -- but we didn't have them,'' Virginia Tech\ncoach Frank Beamer said. \"They're an upset special waiting to\nhappen. They were down near the end zone, and everybody was holding\ntheir breath.''\n\n   The Hokies were ranked as high as No. 3 this season before\nlosing four of their previous five, but Beamer's team put a strong\nfinish on the season with its fifth bowl victory during his tenure.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=131178\">Anthony Butler</a> rushed for 75 yards for Air Force, which finished\nthe season with five losses in its last seven games despite leading\nthe NCAA in rushing.\n\n\"It's the second game we lost in a row on the last play of the\ngame,'' said Air Force coach Fisher DeBerry, whose team dropped its\nregular season finale to San Diego State by four points. \"It's\nsomething we've got to address. I thought our guys fought hard and\nhad a gutty performance.\n\n\"I don't think we lost the football game. I think time ran out\nfor us.''\n\n   Harridge rushed for 70 yards in the Falcons' option offense\nwhile becoming the 16th player in college football history to run\nand pass for 1,000 yards apiece in the same season, but he was\n4-for-19 through the air against the Hokies.\n\nOn the second play from scrimmage, however, Harridge threw a\n47-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=116471\">Anthony Park</a>, who had just 10 receptions all season\n-- a total that made him the third-leading receiver in Air Force's\nground-bound option attack. Moments later, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=140307\">Matt Ward</a> scored on a\n15-yard reverse.\n\nThat long pass was Harridge's only completion until the final 90\nseconds of the game.\n\nThe Hokies fell behind 10-0, but they rallied with Suggs'\nscoring runs and Randall's mobility, which extended several drives.\n\n   \"We just didn't get off the field on third down,'' Air Force\nlinebacker Anthony Schlegel said. \"It's a tribute to their\nquarterback scrambling around.''\n\nA bare-chested fan wearing orange body paint stood next to an Air Force cadet in the enthusiastic crowd of 25,966 at Pacific Bell Park.\n\nThe waterfront was warmer and less windy than it usually is for a San Francisco Giants night baseball game, though the turf was soggy from days of rain. Both teams stood on the same sideline of the field, which stretched from the first-base dugout to the left-field wall.\n\nThe San Francisco Bowl is sponsored by Diamond Walnut.\n\n\"I don't know how many people saw the game because it's New Year's Eve,'' DeBerry said, \"but they missed a great game.''"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Mountain West -
