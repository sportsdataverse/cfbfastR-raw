He turned a short slant into a 51-yard touchdown, went 75\nyards after a leaping grab to set up another score and snaked 39\nyards for a TD on an end around.\n\n\t   \"He might be the best football player I've seen all year,''\nTigers coach Nick Saban said.\n\n\t   After receiving a huge trophy as offensive MVP, Williams said he\ndidn't deserve it -- and didn't object when teammate Rod Babers slid\nit away. Williams then criticized himself for a false start and\nsaid he could do a better job of running routes.\n\n\t   \"I don't feel like I'm the best receiver in the country,''\nWilliams said. \"I don't think I've done what I'm capable of. I\nstill have things to prove, things to learn, before I go to the\nnext level.''\n\n\t   LSU (8-5) would probably disagree. The Tigers came in with the\nsecond-best pass defense in the country, allowing 143 yards per\ngame -- and Williams alone had 142 on four catches.\n\n\t   A strong start by the Tigers had put the Longhorns (11-2) down\n17-7 three minutes into the second quarter.\n\n\t   The Texas offense had gone nowhere on two possessions despite\nhaving all its top skill players healthy for the first time since\nthe second game of the season. The Longhorns' first score came on a\n46-yard fumble return by linebacker <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=129743\">Lee Jackson</a>, the longest in\nCotton Bowl history.\n\n\t   Then Texas unveiled its most effective plan: getting the ball to\nWilliams.\n\n\t   On first down from the 49, he shook cornerback Corey Webster at\nthe line, caught a bullet pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=15739\">Chris Simms</a> in stride and ran\naway to an easy score.\n\n\t   The next time Simms threw to Williams, he made a nice catch in\ntraffic and raced toward the end zone, but was shoved out of bounds\nat the 5-yard line. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=120228\">Cedric Benson</a> did the rest, putting Texas ahead\n21-17.\n\n\t   After a sluggish start to the second half, Williams got Texas\ngoing with an 18-yard catch, then Benson ran for 17 yards. On the\nnext play, Simms faked a handoff to Benson and slipped the ball to\nWilliams coming from the left side. He weaved between defenders and\navoided being hit until the 5; it couldn't stop him from lunging\nacross the goal line.\n\n\t   <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=15764\">Ivan Williams</a> caught an 8-yard touchdown pass from Simms early\nin the fourth quarter, giving Texas a spurt of 28 unanswered\npoints. It would have been more if not for two missed field goals.\n\n\t   Simms finished 15-for-28 for 269 yards and, most important, had\none turnover: an interception on his final pass.\n\n\t   This was a nice farewell for Simms, who leaves 26-6 as a\nstarter. He has the second-most wins in school history and leaves\nwith the best completion percentage, highest efficiency rating and\nprobably most criticism received.\n\n\t   His worst games came in Dallas, especially at this stadium.\nTexas ended a five-game losing streak in the area, including four\nstraight losses at the Cotton Bowl, all of which he played in and\nthree of which he started. The game was sponsored by SBC.\n\n\t   \"I get to walk in here with a smile on my face for once,''\nSimms said as he entered the interview room. \"It's about time,\ntoo.''\n\n\t   The Longhorns have consecutive 11-win seasons for the first time\nand most likely will have consecutive Top 10 season finishes for\nthe first time since 1977-78. It also was the 40th win for the\nSimms-led 1999 recruiting class that came in hailed as the nation's\nbest.\n\n\t   For LSU, this was the second straight time it wasted a 17-7\nlead. Last time it cost them a chance to reach the SEC championship\ngame. This time it ended a streak of five straight bowl wins.\n\n\t   Quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=107723\">Marcus Randall</a> started strong, producing 10\nfirst-quarter points against a defense that had allowed a\nnational-best 16 in the quarter all season. His only mistake was\nthe fumble that turned into Texas' first score.\n\n\t   Randall opened the second quarter with a 76-yard run that was\nthe team's longest play of the season -- one more than his famous\ndesperation pass that beat Kentucky. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=32786\">Domanick Davis</a> capped that\ndrive with a 3-yard TD run.\n\n\t   But the Tigers didn't score again until the fourth quarter.\nRandall struggled, fumbling again and throwing an interception,\nboth deep in Texas territory, and LSU had a failed field goal\nattempt.\n\n\t   \"We left a lot out there,'' Saban said."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
