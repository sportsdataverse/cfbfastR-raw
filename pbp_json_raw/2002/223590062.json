Losman said. \"It was a great vacation and the win makes it so\nmuch sweeter. I'll have a smile on the plane ride home.\"\n\nLosman ran for two touchdowns in the second half and completed\n20 of 39 passes for 240 yards. But Elpheage's returns and the\ndefense sparked Tulane.\n\nElpheage returned a punt for a touchdown and set up Tulane's\ngo-ahead score with another long run. With the Green Wave down 14-6\nin the third quarter, Elpheage scored on a 60-yard return.\n\nElpheage ran back Hawaii's next punt 56 yards, giving Tulane the\nball at the Hawaii 17. That set up the go-ahead touchdown, a 1-yard\nrun by Losman, that made it 20-14.\n\n\"I was just trying to get us going because we came out kind of\nflat in the first half because we were so anxious,\" said Elpheage,\nselected the game's outstanding player after returning four punts\nfor 143 yards. \"I think we settled down and did what we had to\ndo.\"\n\nHe was also part of the defense that kept Hawaii's high-powered\noffense grounded for most of the game by forcing three turnovers\nand recording eight sacks.\n\nJust when the Green Wave appeared to take control of the game on\nMewelde Moore's 25-yard TD run late in the third period that made\n26-14, Hawaii attempted to comeback behind backup quarterback Shawn\nWithy-Allen.\n\nWithy-Allen, who filled in for injured starter Timmy Chang,\nhooked up on a 57-yard scoring pass with Justin Colbert to make it\n26-21. But Losman scored his second rushing TD, a 3-yarder, to\nextend the lead to 34-21.\n\nWithy-Allen and Colbert combined on a 31-yard scoring play to\nnarrow the gap with 5:12 left, but Tulane put the game out of reach\nwhen Roxie Shelvin sacked Withy-Allen in the end zone for a safety,\nmaking it 36-28 with 3:02 left.\n\n\"The punt return by Elpheage was huge for us and the safety was\nbig and gave us another score,\" Scelfo said. \"They made a lot of\nplays, but we just made a couple more.\"\n\nScelfo received a two-year contract extension Wednesday through\nthe 2007 season.\n\nMoore led Tulane in rushing with 30 carries for 116 yards, and\nreceiving with six catches for 80 yards. At the half, Moore had\nonly 22 yards rushing on 12 carries.\n\n\"I had to calm down a little bit,\" he said. \"Once I relaxed\nand played my game, the good Lord just made everything else\nhappen.\"\n\nHawaii took a 14-0 lead in the first half behind short scoring\nruns by Thero Mitchell and Josh Galeai, but Tulane scored 26\nstraight points -- including 20 in the third quarter.\n\n\"We just had to believe in ourselves, calm down and take a deep\nbreath,\" Losman said. \"I think we were pressing a little bit at\nthe beginning, trying a little too hard.\"\n\nHawaii coach June Jones said the Warriors didn't come together\nas a team like Tulane and committed \"stupid\" penalties.\n\n\"It's a team game,\" Jones said. \"If you don't play together\nin all phases, you lose. They beat us. We deserved to lose the\ngame.\"\n\nHawaii was without its offensive leader, Chang, for most of the\ngame after he injured the thumb on his throwing hand in the second\nquarter. Chang completed 14 of 21 passes for 124 yards.\n\nWithy-Allen was forced out of the pocket on almost every play.\nHe was sacked five times, threw an interception and lost two\nfumbles. He finished with 239 yards on 18-of-31 passing.\n\n\"They caused a lot of disruptions. They didn't stop. They kept\ncoming and coming,\" Withy-Allen said.\n\nColbert was Hawaii's top receiver with nine catches for 158\nyards.\n\n\"We didn't protect the quarterback as well as we normally do\nand Shawn doesn't have a quick release as Timmy does and they\nknocked it out of his hand,\" Jones said.\n\nHawaii also was without two starters on the offensive line.\n\n\"I thought the biggest problem for them, is they didn't have\ncontinuity,\" Scelfo said. \"They had two starters out today. The\ncontinuity of an offensive line is critical. We have four seniors\nup there on defense and they've been rushing the passer for a\ncouple years now.\""},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
