(AP) -- While Larry Johnson clamored for the ball,\nRonnie Brown kept getting it.\n\n<photo1>\n\n\t   Brown scored on a 17-yard touchdown run with 2:19 left and\noutplayed the Heisman Trophy finalist as Auburn (No. 22 ESPN/USA Today; No. 19 Associated Press) beat No. 10\nPenn State 13-9 Wednesday in the Capital One Bowl.\n\n\t   The final tally: Brown 184 yards, Johnson just 72.\n\n\t   Johnson, who ran for 2,015 regular-season yards, couldn't break\na long one among his 20 carries in his final Penn State game. The\nNittany Lions (9-4) fell to 1-4 when he failed to reach 100 yards.\n\n\t   Johnson groused that the offense was ''trying to be too cute''\ninstead of just giving it to him.\n\n\t   ''You get 20 carries against a good defense, there's no way in\nthe world you're going to go over 100 against a good defense,''\nsaid Johnson, who lost 6 yards on his first five carries. ''You\npound it and pound it and pound it, and that's the outcome.\n\n\t   ''If we'd have done that, maybe the score would be reversed.''\n\n\t   Maybe not, the Tigers said.\n\n\t   ''All week, the TV and the media were just talking about seeing\nhow far over 200 he's going to get,'' Auburn defensive end Reggie\nTorbor said of Johnson. ''Like we're a joke. We feed off that. The\nmore they talk, the better we get.''\n\n\t   Auburn linebacker Mark Brown said Johnson was on the sidelines\nbegging for the ball.\n\n\t   ''We heard him a couple of times after he made a run telling the\ncoach he could do that all day -- just give the ball to him,'' Brown\nsaid.\n\n\t   Instead, Ronnie Brown kept getting chances.\n\n\t   Brown ran 37 times and scored twice as the Tigers (9-4) won a\nbowl game for the first time since 1998.\n\n\t   Brown, voted the game's most valuable player, was eager to prove himself against\nJohnson.\n\n\t   ''Personally, that gave me a lot of motivation to be going up\nagainst someone like that, a Heisman candidate with so many\nskills,'' the sophomore said. ''And for us to be an underdog, that\nkind of gave us a lift as a team.''\n\n\t   Penn State quarterback Zack Mills was temporarily benched in the\nsecond half and couldn't convert two late drives into points.\n\n\t   Mills threw two consecutive incompletions before getting\nintercepted by Roderick Hood. That gave the Tigers the ball at Penn\nState's 27 with 1:49 left, but four consecutive runs by Brown only\nworked the clock down to 42 seconds.\n\n\t   With no timeouts left, Mills moved it to Auburn's 43 with a\n14-yard scramble and two short passes to Matt Kranchick. His\nshuffle pass under pressure fell short of a first down on fourth\ndown.\n\n\t   ''We just came together and said, 'They're not going to get into\nthe end zone,''' linebacker Dontarrious Thomas said. ''As long as\nthey kept getting field goals, we knew our offense was finally\ngoing to break one into the end zone.''\n\n\t   Penn State's four defeats came by a total of 20 points, as coach\nJoe Paterno failed to pad his NCAA record 20 bowl victories after a\ntwo-year postseason absence.\n\n\t   The Tigers beat their third top 10 opponent of the season.\n\n\t   Brown passed the 1,000-yard mark despite starting only five\ngames.\n\n\t   Down 9-7, the Tigers started their winning drive at Penn State's\n40 with 5:05 left after Robbie Gould's 36-yard punt. Brown carried\non five of the six plays, but Jason Campbell's pass on the\ntwo-point attempt fell short.\n\n\t   Mills finished 8-for-24 for 67 yards and was replaced on two\nseries by Michael Robinson. All-Big Ten receiver Bryant Johnson was\nheld without a catch.\n\n\t   ''The thing about a game like this is you hope someone has a\ngood day,'' Paterno said. ''Larry didn't have a good game, Zach\ndidn't have a good game. They did a great job covering Bryant\nJohnson. It was one of those days -- what am I going to tell you?''\n\n\t   The Nittany Lions' only points came on Gould's field goals of\n21, 27 and 31 yards. He missed a 33-yarder in the first half.\n\n\t   The Tigers borrowed a chapter from Paterno's playbook to take a\n7-6 lead with 3:52 left in the third quarter. They ran it 13\nconsecutive times and milked nearly seven minutes off the clock, with\nBrown twisting into the end zone on fourth down from the goal line.\n\n\t   He carried on the first six plays and the last four, gaining 59\nyards on the drive. The Nittany Lions had gone nearly 10 quarters\nwithout giving up a point in the postseason.\n\n\t   The Tigers trailed 6-0 at halftime, losing two turnovers,\ncommitting 74 yards in penalties and getting Damon Duval's 24-yard\nfield goal try blocked.\n\n\t   ''We tried to shoot ourselves in the foot in the first half, but\nwe cut down on the penalties in the second half and we decided that\nrunning the football was going to win the game for us,'' Auburn\ncoach Tommy Tuberville said."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
