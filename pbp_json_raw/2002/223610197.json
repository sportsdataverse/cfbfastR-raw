The only question left is was it his last.\n\n\t   Woods, considering leaving school early for the NFL, caught nine\npasses for 164 yards and a touchdown in a 33-23 victory over\nSouthern Mississippi in the Houston Bowl on Friday.\n\n\t   \"I'll answer that question in the proper time,'' Woods said\nwhen asked about his future.\n\n\t   Woods earned most valuable player and offensive player of the\ngame honors, helping the Cowboys complete a memorable season that\nincluded victories over Nebraska, Texas A&M and Oklahoma.\n\n\t   \"In the second half, they made up their minds they weren't\ngoing to let me do what I did in the first half and that really\nopened our running game,'' Woods said. \"They wanted to stop the\nrun and they did a good job of it early. In the fourth quarter we\nstarted to wear them down.''\n\n\t   Tatum Bell ran for 160 yards on 13 carries, including a 22-yard\nscore with 8:07 to play that gave Oklahoma State the lead for good.\n\n\t   Luke Phillips kicked two of his four field goals in the decisive\nfourth quarter for the Cowboys (8-5).\n\n\t   Trailing 20-13 at the half, Southern Miss (7-6) took its only\nlead of the game on a 2-yard touchdown run by James Walley and a\n30-yard field goal by Curt Jones, his third of the game, in the\nthird quarter.\n\n\t   The Cowboys pulled even on the first play of the fourth quarter\non Phillips' 28-yard field goal.\n\n\t   Josh Fields threw for 310 yards, and his 33-yard pass to Billy\nBajema set up Bell's go-ahead touchdown, which put Oklahoma State\nback in front 30-23.\n\n\t   Following a punt by Southern Mississippi to the Oklahoma State\n2, Bell broke off a career-long 88-yard gain to the Golden Eagles\n10.\n\n\t   \"Before the play started, I was just trying to move us out of\nthe 2-yard line,'' Bell said. \"But when it started, I saw a little\ncrease and my whole thought process changed. I wanted to take it to\nthe house.''\n\n\t   Bell didn't get the start because he missed a treatment session\nfor a hamstring injury. He was ready in the second half, though.\n\n\t   Southern Mississippi linebacker Rod Davis said he was blitzing\non the play.\n\n\t   \"That was kind of a backbreaker,'' Davis said. \"We had a blitz\ncoming and where I came from, that's where he went.''\n\n\t   Phillips kicked a 24-yarder with 5:15 to play. He also connected\nfrom 46 and 52 yards.\n\n\t   Woods highlighted Oklahoma State's first half with a 51-yard\ntouchdown catch from Fields with 1:38 left in the second quarter.\n\n\t   Woods was double-covered on the play, but Southern Mississippi\ndefenders Greg Brooks and Antoine Cash collided, allowing Woods to\nsprint untouched into the end zone.\n\n\t   Woods had his ninth 100-yard receiving game of the season and\njoined former Cowboys receiver Hart Lee Dykes as the only receivers\nto surpass 3,000 career yards. Woods' touchdown catch was his 17th\nof the season.\n\n\t   The Cowboys took a 10-0 lead on Fields' 3-yard touchdown pass to\nMike Denard and Phillips' 46-yard field goal, set up by an\ninterception by Darrent Williams at the Southern Mississippi 31.\n\n\t   Phillips's 52-yarder in the second quarter tied his career long.\n\n\t   Williams' interception was thrown by Golden Eagles quarterback\nMicky D'Angelo, who started the game despite rib injuries. He was\nreplaced by Dustin Almond, who ran 13 yards for a touchdown in the\nsecond quarter.\n\n\t   The Golden Eagles also played without starting running back\nDerrick Nix, whose kidney condition forced him to give up football\nlast week.\n\n\t   \"I think Derrick Nix is a tremendous inspiration to our\nfootball team,'' Southern Mississippi coach Jeff Bower said. \"Our\nfootball players wanted to win this game for him. It was a\nmotivation. The effort was good enough, but we didn't make the\nplays.''\n\n\t   Oklahoma State played in a bowl game for the first time since\nthe 1997 Alamo Bowl, and won in the postseason for the first time\nsince Barry Sanders ran for 222 yards and five TDs in a 62-14 win\nover Wyoming in the 1988 Holiday Bowl.\n\n\t   \"Running the ball was important for us today,'' Cowboys coach\nLes Miles said. \"Our intensity on defense was a little too much to\nstart the game. We made some great stops early, but extended the\nSouthern Miss drives with penalties.''\n"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
