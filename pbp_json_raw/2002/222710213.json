(AP) -- After blowing a 22-point\nfourth-quarter lead, Iowa settled down during an overtime that must\nhave felt oddly familiar.\n\n\t   C.J. Jones caught a 6-yard touchdown pass in the extra period,\nand Penn State's fourth-down pass fell incomplete as the Hawkeyes\n(4-1) upset the 12-ranked Nittany Lions 42-35 Saturday.\n\n<photo1>\n\n\t   In the Big Ten opener for both teams, Brad Banks passed for 261\nyards to lead Iowa (4-1), and his throw to Jones in the overtime\nwas his fourth touchdown pass.\n\n\t   After the game, Penn State coach Joe Paterno ran over to an\nofficial and grabbed him by the shoulder. It wasn't immediately\nclear which call Paterno was angry about.\n\n\t   It was just the second overtime game for both teams, with the\nfirst coming against each other two years ago. In that game, the\nHawkeyes kicked a field goal in the second OT, then intercepted a\npass from Rashard Casey to win it 26-23.\n\n\t   \"We were hoping our defense would hold Penn State, and they\nwere able to come together and win it for us,'' Fred Russell said.\n\"It felt like it did two years ago, when we won it in overtime\nhere.''\n\n\t   The difference this time was that Iowa had it wrapped up until\nPenn State (3-1) staged a frantic comeback in the last 7½ minutes\nof regulation.\n\n\t   Penn State's defense started the comeback when Bryan Scott\nintercepted a pass in the end zone that could have put the game\naway for Iowa. Jovon Johnson intercepted it right back for Iowa and\nreturned it to the Penn State 1-yard line, but Michael Haynes\nforced Russell to fumble on the next play.\n\n\t   \"If we protect the ball a little better in the second half,\nit's probably not as exciting,'' Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said.\n\n\t   Zack Mills completed 23 of 44 passes for a school-record 399\nyards. Three of his four touchdown passes came in the fourth\nquarter to three different players named Johnson: 36 yards to\nLarry, 44 yards to Tony -- followed by a 2-point conversion run by\nChris Ganter -- and 8 yards to Bryant. That tied it at 35 with 1:20\nleft.\n\n\t   Penn State wasn't nearly effective on its OT possession,\nhowever. On second-and-8 from the 9-yard line, Mills threw to Tony\nJohnson 2 yards out on the left sideline, but Johnson was ruled out\nof bounds. Two plays later, Mills' final pass attempt hit one of\nhis offensive linemen and fell to the ground to end the game.\n\n\t   \"We made some mistakes'' in the fourth quarter, Iowa defensive\nback Bob Sanders said. \"But we corrected those and ended up doing\nthe job.''\n\n\t   Bryant Johnson had eight catches for 146 yards and two\ntouchdowns, and Tony Johnson had four catches for 111 yards and one\nscore.\n\n\t   But until the fourth quarter, Penn State's offense was anemic.\nThe Nittany Lions finished with just 54 yards rushing, and Michael\nRobinson -- the backup quarterback who scored five touchdowns on 12\ncarries in Penn State's last two games -- had minus-2 yards on four\ncarries.\n\n\t   Mills said his final pass also was intended for Robinson.\n\n\t   \"He was the guy I was supposed to go to,'' Mills said. \"I\ndidn't make the right read. It was my fault.''\n\n\t   Iowa has won three straight against Penn State and four of the\nlast five, and Iowa is just the third school to beat a\nPaterno-coached team three years in a row. Alabama (1987-89) and\nMichigan (1997-2001) also did it.\n\n\t   Banks threw a 54-yard touchdown pass to Maurice Brown on the\nright sideline to give Iowa a 35-13 lead with 7:03 left in the\nthird quarter, Iowa's last score in regulation. Brown finished with\n100 yards on four catches, and Russell had 142 yards on 35 carries.\n\n\t   Banks' 22-yard touchdown pass to Ed Hinkel gave the Hawkeyes a\n23-0 lead with 6:04 left in the first half, but Derek Wake blocked\nNate Kaeding's PAT try, ending Kaeding's school-record streak at\n60.\n\n\t   Kaeding did have a 55-yard field goal, which bounced off the\nleft upright and fell through as time expired in the first half,\ngiving the Hawkeyes a 26-7 lead. It was the longest of Kaeding's\ncareer and his 13th consecutive field goal, a school record.\n\n\t   Shawn Mayer's interception, and long passes to Tony Johnson and\nBryant Johnson, set up Larry Johnson's 1-yard touchdown run, making\nit 26-13 early in the third quarter. But Robbie Gould's PAT try was\nblocked, and D.J. Johnson ran the ball back 99 yards for 2 points.\n"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
