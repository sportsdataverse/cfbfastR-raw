In their first head-to-head meeting, he finally\npassed him.\n\n<photo1>Lundy scored four touchdowns and gained 239 all-purpose yards as\nVirginia snapped a four-game bowl losing streak Saturday with a\n48-22 victory over No. 15 West Virginia in the inaugural\nContinental Tire Bowl.\n\nCobourne, who was four years ahead of Lundy at Holy Cross High\nSchool in southern New Jersey, ran for 117 yards and two touchdowns\nfor West Virginia.\n\n\"Growing up, a lot of people always tried to measure me against\nhim,'' Lundy said. \"I never did. I always tried to be my own\nplayer.''\n\nBefore he could finish talking about his days following\nCobourne, Virginia coach Al Groh interrupted his star freshman.\n\n\"I don't think this guy needs to measure himself against\nanybody,'' Groh said. \"He's going to be a big-time player.''\n\nLundy, who came in averaging 53.8 yards rushing and 27.6\nreceiving, ran for 127 and caught five passes for 76 yards. He\nscored touchdowns on runs of 4 and 31 yards. He caught a 14-yard TD\npass from Marques Hagans and a 48-yard TD pass from Matt Schaub.\n\nHe said Cobourne had little to say to him after the game.\n\n\"He just said 'Good game,''' Lundy said. \"You don't really\nwant to talk to another player after a game like that.''\n\nCobourne, who said he barely knows Lundy, still praised his\nperformance.\n\n\"He played well. I mean, he represented,'' Cobourne said.\n\"He's got the talent, he started as a freshman, so I knew he had\nit in him. I was hoping he wouldn't unleash it today.''\n\nSchaub, the ACC player of the year, threw for 182 yards and a\nscore and Hagans returned a punt 69 yards for his second touchdown\nas the Cavaliers (9-5) won their first postseason game since the\n1995 Peach Bowl.\n\nVirginia did an excellent job slowing down Cobourne, the Big\nEast's all-time leading rusher, who came into the game averaging\n141 yards a game.\n\nHe ran for 54 in the first quarter and scored on a 6-yard run\nbut didn't gain a single yard in the second quarter. He finished\nwith 117 yards -- the 28th 100-yard game of his career.\n\nCobourne added a 1-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter, but a\n2-point conversion attempt by the Mountaineers (9-4) failed, and\nthe TD only cut the score to 41-22 with 7:17 to play.\n\nCobourne ended his career with 5,039 yards, ninth-best in NCAA\nDivision I-A history. But it was the bowl win he most wanted,\nespecially a convincing victory, to prove that the Mountaineers\ndeserved to be in a bigger bowl. They were passed over for the\nGator Bowl despite finishing second in the Big East when officials\ntook Notre Dame instead.\n\n\"It sure was a bad way to end a good year,'' said West Virginia\ncoach Rich Rodriguez, who turned the Mountaineers around from a 3-8\nrecord last season.\n\n\"There's some players hurting in the locker room, because\nthat's not the way we were playing football at the end of the\nseason.''\n\nThe Cavaliers also felt slighted at being in the Tire Bowl. They\nfinished second in their conference and felt they deserved a berth\nin a New Year's Day game.\n\nThe initial disappointment wore off when fans from both schools\nsnapped up the 73,535 tickets -- painting Ericsson Stadium in a sea\nof blue-and-gold West Virginia fans and orange-and-blue Cavs\nsupporters.\n\nBut Virginia, which quietly went about its business all week,\nfelt a second slight by the Mountaineers' confidence, and rumors\nthat West Virginia players had guaranteed a victory.\n\n\"I don't think they took us seriously,'' Schaub said.\n\"Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but we knew what we\nhad and what we could do. In the end, we were the ones who\nexecuted, not them.''\n\nThe Mountaineers were uncharacteristically sloppy. They came\ninto the game with the second-best turnover margin in the nation at\nplus-21, but quarterback Rasheed Marshall was intercepted by\nAlmondo Curry in the third quarter, and Phil Braxton's pass after a\npitch from Marshall was intercepted by Darryl Blackstock.\n\t"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
