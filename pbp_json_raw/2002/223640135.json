(AP) -- If Minnesota coach Glen Mason had his\nway, Dan Nystrom would not have been the Most Valuable Player of\nthe Music City Bowl.\n\n\t   Nystrom tied an NCAA record by kicking five field goals as\nMinnesota upset Arkansas 29-14 on Monday for the Golden\nGophers' first bowl victory since 1985.\n\n<photo1>\n\n\t   \"I wish he was standing next to me and we were scoring\ntouchdowns. I've got a lot of respect for this guy. He's had some\nslumps, and he's had periods where he kicked well,'' Mason said of\nthe senior kicker. \"He had a great day today.''\n\n\t   The Gophers (8-5) had lost three straight bowls since beating\nClemson in the 1985 Independence Bowl. They came into the game\nhaving blown their best start since 1961 by losing their final four\ngames of the regular season and finishing seventh in the Big Ten.\n\n\t   Arkansas (9-5, No. 25 AP), the SEC's Western Division champ, was seeking\nits first 10-win season since going 10-2 in 1989. But Minnesota,\nwith only two senior starters, dominated the Razorbacks. Arkansas\nis now 1-10 in its last 11 bowl games.\n\n\t   The Gophers controlled the ball and forced four turnovers,\nincluding two interceptions by senior cornerback Michael Lehan.\nAsad Abdul-Khaliq threw for a touchdown in the third quarter and\nThomas Tapeh added a 33-yard run in the fourth.\n\n\t   \"If Danny wasn't on the top of his game, then it would've been\na lot tougher to win,'' said Abdul-Khaliq, who was 16-of-31 for 216\nyards passing.\n\n\t   Nystrom bailed the Gophers out in the first half, when they\nrepeatedly stalled near the goal line. He had kicks of 24, 45, 21\nand 22 yards in the first half for a 12-7 halftime lead and added a\n29-yarder in the fourth. His first three kicks made him the Big\nTen's career field-goal leader, passing Travis Dorsch, who had 68\nat Purdue.\n\n\t   Told about Mason's comments, Nystrom quickly agreed that he'd\nrather stand beside the coach watching the Golden Gophers score\ntouchdowns.\n\n\t   \"I'm surprised to win the MVP. Kickers never win MVP,'' he\nsaid. \"It's a great ending for my career.''\n\n\t   The senior became the fifth kicker with five field goals in a\nbowl game and the first since Dec. 28, 1995 when Texas A&M's Kyle\nBryant did it in the Alamo Bowl against Michigan.\n\n\t   Nystrom might have had six field goals, but Minnesota chose to\ngo for it on fourth-and-5 from the Arkansas 25 and turned the ball\nover on downs with 2:46 left.\n\n\t   Minnesota's failure to score touchdowns allowed the Razorbacks\nto stay close, despite the Gophers holding the ball for more than\n38 minutes and having 434 total yards of offense compared to the\nRazorbacks' 288.\n\n\t   \"We're better than that,'' Arkansas coach Houston Nutt said.\n\"We didn't perform like we should have. We didn't know where we\nwere on the field defensively. We're usually so aggressive.''\n\n\t   The Razorbacks started strong, putting together a 74-yard\nscoring drive on their first possession. The SEC's best rushing\nteam went to the air as Matt Jones started with a 29-yard pass to\nRichard Smith and capped the drive with a 2-yard TD pass to George\nWilson.\n\n\t   That turned out to be their best possession of the game,\nhowever, as they rushed for only 80 yards, well below their average\nof 226.9 per game.\n\n\t   Nutt pulled Jones in the fourth quarter, putting in Ryan\nSorahan. It was too late, and his first drive ended when Fred\nTalley fumbled at midfield.\n\n\t   Minnesota had no trouble moving the ball against an Arkansas\ndefense ranked 40th in the nation. The Golden Gophers had drives of\n10, 13 and 10 plays, but were stopped three times inside the\nArkansas 7 before halftime.\n\n\t   Arkansas had a chance to take the lead just before halftime when\nJones found Smith in the end zone for what would have been a\n31-yard TD catch, but Smith was ruled out of bounds.\n"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"SEC -
