The Deacons last had\nconsecutive winning seasons in 1987-88.\n\n\t   \"I couldn't ask for a better game to finish out my career here\nat Wake Forest,'' MacPherson said.\n\n\t   The Ducks (7-6) started the season 6-0 and were ranked as high\nas No. 6, but they simply weren't the same without quarterback Joey\nHarrington, a 2001 Heisman finalist. The team lost five of its last\nsix, a year after going 11-1 and winning the Fiesta Bowl.\n\n\t   Entering Monday's game, Wake Forest was ranked eighth nationally\nin rushing offense, averaging 239.9 yards a game. The Deacons ran\nfor 256 against Oregon, even with their early emphasis on the\npassing game.\n\n\t   \"We knew going against Oregon that they had a real good rushing\ndefense, so we knew we could have a typical game plan,'' Wake\nForest coach Jim Grobe said.\n\n\t   Oregon coach Mike Bellotti said the Ducks figured as much.\n\n\t   \"I expected a little bit more than they've thrown the rest of\nthe year,'' he said. \"Our problem was missed plays.''\n\n\t   The Ducks opened the game with Jared Siegel's 45-yard field\ngoal, but Wake Forest answered with a seven-play, 65-yard drive,\ntopped by Ovie Mughelli's 1-yard run.\n\n\t   Oregon starter Jason Fife completed just 1 of 7 passes for 4\nyards before he was replaced late in the first quarter by redshirt\nfreshman Kellen Clemens.\n\n\t   MacPherson fared batter, hitting Anderson with a 57-yard scoring\npass early in the second quarter to push Wake's lead to 14-3.\nMacPherson added a 1-yard touchdown dash with 2:40 left before\nhalftime.\n\n\t   With 26 seconds left in the half, Clemens hit Samie Parker with\na 7-yard scoring strike to make it 21-10.\n\n\t   Matt Wisnosky had a 43-yard field goal for Wake Forest before\nOregon's Matt Floberg narrowed it to 24-17 on a 1-yard run with\n5:39 left in the third quarter.\n\n\t   MacPherson, who had just six touchdown passes going into the\ngame, closed the third quarter with his 63-yard touchdown pass to\nAnderson. Chris Barclay added a 12-yard TD run late in the game for\nthe final margin.\n\n\t   Anderson caught three passes for a career-best 157 yards.\n\n\t   Clemens finished 19-of-31 for 161 yards.\n\n\t   \"We attacked them, but I don't think we attacked them enough,''\nsaid Oregon receiver Keenan Howry.\n\n\t   Oregon tailback Onterrio Smith, who missed three of the last\nfour games with an injury to his left knee that required surgery in\nlate November, gained 62 yards on 18 carries in what would be his\nfinal college game if he declares himself eligible for the NFL\ndraft. In nine regular-season games, Smith ran for 1,079 yards and\n12 touchdowns.\n\n\t   Barclay led the Deacons with 82 yards on 19 carries. Tailback\nTarence Williams, who got off to a slow start this season but\nrushed for 550 yards in his final five games, had 53 yards on 16\ncarries.\n\n\t   Late in the third quarter, Williams appeared to twist his left\nknee on a run and spent several minutes prone on the field as\ntrainers attended to him. He was taken from the field by cart and\ndid not return.\n\n\t   Wake Forest defensive end Calvin Pace remained one sack short of\nthe school record of 30 set by Mike McCrary. Pace broke his left\nleg Nov. 23 against Navy and practiced for the first time Thursday.\n\n\t   The second annual Seattle Bowl marked the first meeting between\nthe Ducks and Demon Deacons since Dec. 31, 1992 in the Independence\nBowl in Shreveport, La. Wake Forest won 39-35.\n"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Pac 12 - North","standings":{"entries":[{"team":"Oregon","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2483/oregon","id":"2483","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2483","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"10-4","displayValue":"10-4"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"7-2","displayValue":"7-2"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2483.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-10-09T13:27Z"}]},{"team":"Washington State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/265/washington-state","id":"265","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:265","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"7-6","displayValue":"7-6"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"6-3","displayValue":"6-3"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/265.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Oregon State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/204/oregon-state","id":"204","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:204","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"7-6","displayValue":"7-6"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"5-4","displayValue":"5-4"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/204.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"California","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/25/california","id":"25","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:25","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"5-7","displayValue":"5-7"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"4-5","displayValue":"4-5"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/25.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Washington","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/264/washington","id":"264","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:264","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"4-8","displayValue":"4-8"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"3-6","displayValue":"3-6"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/264.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2019-07-12T19:04Z"}]},{"team":"Stanford","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/24/stanford","id":"24","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:24","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"3-9","displayValue":"3-9"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"2-7","displayValue":"2-7"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/24.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]}]}},{"header":"Pac 12 -
