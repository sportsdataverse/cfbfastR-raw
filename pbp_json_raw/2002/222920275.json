(AP) -- Instead of dancing on the Wisconsin\nBadgers' logo, the Ohio State Buckeyes gathered at midfield and\nknelt in prayer.\n\n<photo1>\n\n\t   The fourth-ranked Buckeyes might have been thankful to pull out\nanother close game on the road, edging Wisconsin 19-14 at Camp\nRandall Stadium on Saturday to keep alive their hopes of a national\ntitle.\n\n\t   The visiting team has won the last four games in this series,\nbut the Buckeyes (8-0, 3-0 Big Ten) ended a recent trend in which\nthe victorious players danced on the other team's logo.\n\n\t   Ohio State has just three formidable opponents left -- Penn\nState, Minnesota and Michigan -- and they all must go to Columbus.\nSince the Buckeyes don't play Iowa this season and don't have to\nplay in a conference championship, they could have the inside track\nto a Fiesta Bowl berth.\n\n\t   \"There have been some questions about the quality of our\nschedule,'' defensive tackle Tim Anderson said. \"But this was\ncertainly a quality win for us.''\n\n\t   Freshman Maurice Clarett ran for 133 yards on 30 carries to lead\nthe Buckeyes, who also escaped Cincinnati and Northwestern with\nclose calls.\n\n\t   Clarett had a shoulder stinger on his final carry. But coach Jim\nTressel said his running back -- who is closing in on Robert Smith's\nschool freshman rushing record -- should be just fine for next\nweek's game against Penn State.\n\n\t   The Badgers (5-3, 0-3), who lost for the eighth time in their\nlast 10 conference home games, took a 14-13 lead into the fourth\nquarter, but Craig Krenzel threw a 3-yard TD pass to Ben Hartsock\nwith 10 minutes left to put the Buckeyes back in front 19-14.\n\n\t   \"I was catching that with every part of my body possible,''\nHartsock said. \"It was like there was a baby in there.''\n\n\t   Michael Jenkins caught five passes for 114 yards and a touchdown\nfor Ohio State. Krenzel completed 12 of 19 passes for 204 yards,\nand Chris Gamble made big plays on both sides of the ball.\n\n\t   Krenzel overthrew Ryan Hamby on the 2-point conversion after the\nTD pass to Hartsock, but the Badgers had to use a timeout because\nthey had only 10 men on defense.\n\n\t   Wisconsin also burned a timeout on a first down on offense, and\nthose two stoppages cost them. The Buckeyes took over with 4:29\nleft and ran the ball nine straight times to use up the clock.\n\n\t   Krenzel set up the winning score with a 45-yard pass to Jenkins\non third-and-6 from his own 16. Jenkins, who caught a 47-yard\ntouchdown pass in the first half, outleaped B.J. Tucker and Brett\nBell for the ball.\n\n\t   \"I just saw the ball in the air for a very long time,'' Tucker\nsaid. \"By the time it came down, I swatted through it. I didn't\nthink he was going to come down with it, but somehow he did.''\n\n\t   That play was the backbreaker, Badgers coach Barry Alvarez said.\n\n\t   \"They hadn't done much for a quarter and a half, and the ball\nwas up in the air. We had two guys in position. No one made a play\non the ball,'' Alvarez said.\n\n\t   The Badgers reached the Buckeyes 29 on the next series, but\nGamble, a flanker, lined up at cornerback and intercepted Jim\nSorgi's pass toward Jonathan Orr in the end zone.\n\n\t   \"You see the way he can go after a football,'' Tressel said.\n\"It doesn't matter if it was intended for him or if he was\ncovering the guy. He can go up and catch the football. He is just\noutrunning athletes, and you wish you could play him all the\ntime.''\n\n\t   Sorgi replaced starter Brooks Bollinger, who got a concussion on\nhis fourth sack midway through the second quarter. Sorgi put\nWisconsin ahead 14-13 with a 42-yard touchdown strike to Orr just\nbefore halftime.\n\n\t   Both teams flashed their quick-strike capability in the first\nhalf. Jenkins caught a 47-yard touchdown pass from Krenzel when\nTucker went for the interception in man coverage and fell down.\n\n\t   The Badgers responded with their own three-play scoring drive\nlater in the first quarter when Anthony Davis (25 carries for 125\nyards) scored untouched on a 41-yard run to tie it at 7.\n\n\t   Two plays later, Krenzel hit Gamble on what would have been an\n80-yard touchdown play, had Gamble not tripped at the Wisconsin 32.\nThe Buckeyes settled for Mike Nugent's school-record 16th\nconsecutive field goal, a chip shot from 27 yards, for a 10-7 lead.\n\n\t   Nugent's 25-yarder made it 13-7 after Ohio State safety Mike\nDoss recovered Bollinger's fumble at the Badgers 32. Doss had 14\ntackles.\n\n\t   The Badgers, who fell to 0-9-1 against top-five teams under\nAlvarez, drove to the Buckeyes 28 before Bollinger was sacked on\nconsecutive snaps. The last one, by Simon Fraser, put the Badgers\nout of field-goal range and ended Bollinger's afternoon.\n"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
