State.\nBOISE, Idaho (AP) -- A cold, wet and dreary morning turned into a\ndelightful afternoon for Boise State.\n\n\t   The weather didn't improve, but it hardly mattered to the\nBroncos (No. 15 ESPN/USA Today, No. 18 AP) as they beat Iowa State 34-16 Tuesday in the Humanitarian\nBowl.\n\n<photo1>\n\n\t   \"The conditions were kind of tough in the first half, but later\non they didn't become a factor,'' said Brock Forsey, who ran for\nthree touchdowns to lead the Broncos. \"In fact, we played\nbetter.''\n\n\t   Forsey, who scored on runs of 4, 2 and 9 yards, finished the\nseason with 32 touchdowns, the second-highest season total in\nDivision I-A. Barry Sanders has the record with 39 for Oklahoma\nState in 1988.\n\n\t   With temperatures in the low 40s and a steady rain falling, the\nconditions were hardly typical for a bowl game. It didn't\ndiscourage 30,446 fans, nearly all of whom showed up to cheer on\nthe Broncos (12-1).\n\n\t   Boise State won its third Humanitarian Bowl in four seasons. The\nBroncos also won it in 2000 and 1999. The Western Athletic\nConference champions went 7-0 at home this season.\n\n\t   Bobby Hammer was voted MVP of the game after he had 10 tackles,\nincluding three for a loss.\n\n\t   \"It was a dream season. Can't describe it right now,'' Hammer\nsaid. \"We set goals high. But we wanted to do more than set them.\nWe wanted to achieve them.''\n\n\t   The Cyclones (7-7), who opened the season at 6-1 and reached the\ntop 10 for the first time in school history, had a 1-6 finish.\n\n\t   \"It was not a disappointment to me. It would be only if you let\nit be,'' Iowa State quarterback Seneca Wallace said.\n\n\t   Wallace hyperextended his knee in the first quarter and missed a\ncouple of series. The Cyclones' offense never recovered.\n\n\t   \"We had a good stretch of games,'' Wallace said. \"I don't know\nif we ran out of gas or what. We just didn't have the fire we did\nin the first part of the season.''\n\n\t   Boise State scored at least 34 points in each of its victories\nthis season. The Broncos needed only half that as they shut down\nIowa State.\n\n\t   Wallace, the Cyclone quarterback who was an early Heisman Trophy\ncontender, had been averaging 268.6 yards of total offense. He had\n190 Tuesday, most of it coming after Boise State already had taken\ncommand.\n\n\t   Iowa State's loss dropped Big 12 Conference teams to 3-3 in bowl\ngames with No. 8 Oklahoma and No. 9 Texas still to play.\n\n\t   Three Iowa State starters were ruled ineligible for the game\nbecause of low grades. They might not have been much help as the\nCyclones battled a boisterous crowd in Bronco Stadium all day.\n\n\t   \"We expect our kids to hold up whoever's in the lineup,'' Iowa\nState coach Dan McCarney said. \"We've got plenty of guys on our\nteam. Plenty of depth and plenty of players on our team that could\nplay better and should play better.''\n\n\t   The crowd was at its loudest to start the second half with the\nBroncos trailing 10-7.\n\n\t   Boise State forced Iowa State into going three-and-out on the\nCyclones' first four possessions of the second half, and the\nBroncos capitalized with two touchdowns to take a lead they would\nnot relinquish.\n\n\t   Ryan Dinwiddie completed passes of 11, 17 and 16 yards to Billy\nWingfield before Forsey scored from 2 yards to make it 14-10,\nending a quick drive that started at the Boise State 46.\n\n\t   After a punt set up the Broncos at their own 49, Lou Fanucchi\ntook a reverse 25 yards to help set up Dinwiddie's 1-yard TD run\nthat put the Broncos up 21-10 with 4 minutes left in the third.\n\n\t   Forsey, who had 24 carries for 78 yards, added a 9-yard TD run\nin the fourth quarter and Dinwiddie threw a 3-yard TD pass to\nFanucchi with 27 seconds left in the game. Dinwiddie was 17-for-32\nfor 160 yards and ran for a touchdown.\n\n\t   \"We probably there at the end could have taken a knee and been\ngood, but that's not the way we play football around here,'' Boise\nState coach Dan Hawkins said. \"That's not our deal. We're going to\nattack. We're going to keep going.''\n\n\t   Wallace missed two series after getting hit on the left knee in\nthe first quarter as the Cyclones drove to the Boise State 13.\nBackup Cris Love and the Cyclone offense went backward on the first\ntwo plays, and Iowa State settled for a 30-yard field goal by Adam\nBenike.\n\n\t   By the time Wallace returned, the Broncos had taken a 7-3 lead\non a 4-yard run by Forsey. Iowa State regained the lead on a 6-yard\ntouchdown pass from Wallace to Jamaul Montgomery with 2:29 left in\nthe half.\n\n\t   \"I felt all right. I just went out and tried to do what I\ncould,'' Wallace said.\n\t   \n\n\n"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
