Orton passed for\n283 yards and two touchdowns as Purdue overcame a 17-point deficit\nto beat Washington 34-24 in the Wells Fargo Sun Bowl on Tuesday.\n\n<photo1>\n\n\t   Although Purdue (7-6) has gone to six straight bowl games under\ncoach Joe Tiller, it had lost its last three before beating\nWashington.\n\n\t   In last year's Sun Bowl, Orton broke three game records with 74\npassing attempts, 38 completions and 419 yards. But Purdue lost\n33-27 to Washington State.\n\n\t   \"We haven't proved how good we are in our last four bowl\nappearances, so today we redeemed ourselves,'' Orton said.\n\n\t   Tiller has never had a losing season at Purdue since taking over\nfor the start of the 1997 season.\n\n\t   \"We played well here last year, but came up a little bit\nshort,'' Tiller said. \"But we were not to be denied this year.''\n\n\t   John Standeford caught 10 passes for 105 yards and a touchdown,\nand Taylor Stubblefield caught seven passes for 92 yards for\nPurdue, which had 400 yards of offense to the Huskies' 316.\n\n\t   It wasn't easy for the Boilermakers, who overcame an early\n17-point deficit.\n\n\t   \"We got behind, but we never rolled over,'' Tiller said. \"In\nan era where many teams do, we did not.''\n\n\t   Cody Pickett was 25-of-54 with one interception and a touchdown\nfor Washington (7-6). The Huskies took a 17-0 lead after the first\nquarter but did not score again until the fourth quarter.\n\n\t   \"I can't explain why we played so poorly,'' Huskies coach Rick\nNeuheisel said. \"We weren't clicking, but it was OK because Purdue\nhadn't caught their stride. But once they caught their stride, the\ngame got away from us.''\n\n\t   Purdue started its rally with 5:09 left in the second quarter\nwhen Orton threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to Standeford.\n\n\t   The Boilermakers scored again with 35 seconds before halftime on\na bit of luck. Brandon Jones fumbled on the 1-yard line, but Ray\nWilliams recovered the ball in the end zone to cap a 66-yard drive\nand make it 17-14 at the break.\n\n\t   After a 22-yard field goal by Berin Lacevic tied the game,\nPurdue took its first lead with 3:33 left in the third quarter on a\n10-yard touchdown run by Joey Harris to make it 24-17. Harris led\nthe Boilermakers with 93 yards on 23 carries.\n\n\t   \"We know how to come from behind,'' Harris said. \"We've beaten\nadversity all year.''\n\n\t   Washington had a total of 44 yards rushing on 24 carries.\n\n\t   The Huskies finally scored again when Pickett threw a 12-yard\ntouchdown pass to Patrick Reddick to make it 34-24 with 3:31\nremaining.\n\n\t   Washington's last scoring attempt failed when John Anderson\nmissed a 24-yard field goal with 15 seconds remaining.\n\n\t   \"It was a disappointing year, we have to get back to work,''\nNeuheisel said. \"To get back to the upper echelon. Not only in our\nconference but in the national picture. This is not what I\nenvisioned for the Washington Huskies.''\n\n\t   In the first quarter, the Huskies needed less than three minutes\nto rack up 14 points.\n\n\t   Purdue kicker Brent Slaton fumbled a snap, and Washington\nrecovered at the 7-yard line. On the next play, Pickett threw a\ntouchdown pass to Reddick to give Washington a 7-0 lead.\n\n\t   Reddick was Washington's leading receiver with 63 yards on six\ncatches for two touchdowns.\n\n\t   On Purdue's next series, Orton fumbled the snap, and Marquis\nCooper recovered for the Huskies and ran the ball 31 yards for a\ntouchdown to push Washington's lead to 14-0 with 8:40 left in the\nquarter.\n\n\t   \"We were up 17-0 early, but it could have been 24 or 28 to\nnothing,'' Neuheisel said. \"We squandered too many\nopportunities.''\n"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
