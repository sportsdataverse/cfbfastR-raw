They also won a bowl\nfor the first time in 17 years, removing some of the sting from\nlast season's 56-23 loss to Florida in the Orange Bowl on Jan. 2.\n\n\t   The win came in the Georgia Dome, where Maryland won the 2002\nNCAA basketball title in March.\n\n\t   \"This is the last day of 2002,'' Friedgen said. \"On the\n(second) day of the year we played in the Orange Bowl. Then our\nbasketball team won the national championship in this very\nbuilding.\n\n\t   \"And now this. It's been a heck of a year for the old Terps.''\n\n\t   The Terrapins (11-3) were outgained 287-274, but pulled away\nthanks to a stingy, opportunistic defense.\n\n\t   All-American linebacker E.J. Henderson had three sacks, four\ntackles for a loss, broke up four passes and forced a fumble. He\nwas selected as the defensive Most Outstanding Player.\n\n\t   \"I knew I had to pull my end of the rope,'' Henderson said.\n\"It's a great feeling to go out the way I did.''\n\n\t   After a 1-2 start, including a 22-0 loss to Notre Dame in the\nKickoff Classic, the Terrapins recovered to win 10 of their last\n11. Friedgen, a 1970 Maryland graduate, is the first coach in\nschool history to win at least 10 games in back-to-back seasons.\n\n\t   \"Winning 11 games after starting 1-2 is something I will never\nforget,'' Friedgen said. \"That was so emotional.''\n\n\t   The Volunteers (8-5) completed their worst season since 1988,\nand gave coach Phillip Fulmer the most losses of his 11-year\ncareer. Twice the defense had to call a timeout after appearing\nconfused, and two roughing-the-passer penalties helped sustain\nMaryland scoring drives.\n\n\t   \"I take full responsibility for the game and the lack of\nexecution,'' Fulmer said. \"Our discipline wasn't what it needed to\nbe. There are a number of things that happened that are my\nresponsibility.''\n\n\t   McBrien, the Most Outstanding Player on offense, finished\n11-of-19 for 120 yards. Bruce Perry, finally healthy after a\nlengthy recovery from a torn groin, ran for 50.\n\n\t   \"It's funny, because I don't think it was one of my top\nperformances,'' McBrien said. \"But other guys stepped up when I\nwasn't there to make the play.''\n\n\t   Tennessee's Casey Clausen completed 23-of-37 passes for 242\nyards, but made an ill-timed throw in the second quarter to give\nMaryland the momentum.\n\n\t   Scrambling out of the pocket, he lofted a screen pass toward an\narea cluttered with offensive linemen. Cox ran in and picked it\noff, then raced across the field and sprinted away from everyone\nfor his second touchdown of the season.\n\n\t   This one gave the Terrapins a 14-0 lead, and they cruised from\nthere.\n\n\t   \"It's a mentality,'' Clausen said. \"It's been a long time\nsince we've been physically whipped. We lost way too many games\nthis year. That's going to change.''\n\n\t   Maryland's only turnover came early in the third quarter, when\nwide receiver Latrez Harrison fumbled after a 17-yard reception.\nMark Jones recovered and returned it 18 yards to the Terrapins 41,\nthe best field position of the game for the Volunteers.\n\n\t   Tennessee eventually drove to the 12 and had first-and-10. But\nHenderson forced a fumble on the next play with a hard hit on\nDerrick Tinsley, and cornerback Domonique Foxworth recovered at the\n7-yard line.\n\n\t   Novak completed the ensuing drive with his second field goal,\nextending the lead to 20-3, and McBrien added his final touchdown\nearly in the fourth quarter to put it away.\n\n\t   \"We wanted to get after them,'' Henderson said. \"We knew if we\nstopped their run, we'd stop them, because they're a\none-dimensional team.''\n"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
