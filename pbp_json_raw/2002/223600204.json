I was just going out, not trying to be macho about it, that I can do whatever I want if I want to do it.''\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=107497\">Brandon Miree</a> rushed for 113 yards, including a 7-yard touchdown run, and was selected the game's MVP.\n\n\"We knew they were a tough defense, No. 10 in the nation coming in,'' Miree said. \"But we felt we were a physical football team. We've been physical with all the teams that we played this year. I think we opened some eyes around the country.''\n\nJackson, who had gained fewer than 100 yards in just three games\nall season, broke loose only once, a 60-yard gain that was called\nback by a holding penalty.\n\n\"They played very physical against us,'' Oregon State coach\nErickson said. \"It did surprise me, because I thought we could run\nthe football against most people, and we couldn't tonight.''\n\nShawn Robinson became the first Pitt player to return a punt for\na touchdown in the school's 22 bowl appearances.\n\n\"It was easy for me,'' Robinson said of his first career punt return for a TD in his final collegiate game. \"My teammates did all the work.''\n\n   The Panthers (9-4) broke a 10-10 tie with a pair of TDs in the\nthird quarter. Tez Morris' interception set up the go-ahead\ntouchdown on Rutherford's 1-yard run, then Robinson broke a pair of\ntackles en route to his 66-yard punt return to make it 24-10 with\n3:26 to go in the third quarter.\n\n\"That was the turning point,'' Harris said, \"that and the\nfield goal at the end of the half.''\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=122255\">Derek Anderson</a> completed 21 of 44 passes for 318 yards for\nOregon State (8-5). <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=30414\">James Newson</a> caught 10 for 165 yards for the\nBeavers, including a remarkable 65-yard touchdown play.\n\nRutherford was 13-for-26 for 183 yards. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=134936\">Larry Fitzgerald</a> made a diving grab of Rutherford's 40-yard pass for the game's first touchdown.\n\nAfter Fitzgerald's touchdown grab on Pitt's first possession,\nthe Beavers scored in equally spectacular fashion.\n\nNewson caught Anderson's pass near midfield and was hit by\ndefenders Torrie Cox and Brian Beinecke. Newson went down, but\ncaught himself with his right hand and his knee never touched the\nground.\n\nThe Oregon State receiver scampered to his feet and ran to the\nend zone on a 65-yard scoring play to tie it at 7 with 9:52 to go\nin the first quarter.\n\n\"I didn't feel my knees touch the ground. The only thing that\ntouched the ground was my forearm,'' Newson said, \"so I just got\nup and started running.''\n\n   The Beavers took a 10-7 lead on Kirk Yliniemi's Insight\nBowl-record 50-yard field goal, then Pittsburgh tied it at 10 on\nDavid Abdul's 45-yarder as the half ended.\n\nYliniemi also kicked a 34-yarder with 34 seconds left in the third quarter, his 15th consecutive made field goal to tie a school record."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Atlantic Coast Conference -
