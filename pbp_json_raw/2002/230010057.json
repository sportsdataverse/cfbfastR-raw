(AP) -- For all the problems Michigan tailback Chris\nPerry gave Florida on the field, nothing matched what Gators coach\nRon Zook did to his own team.\n\n<photo1>\n\n\t   Perry set a Wolverines bowl record with four touchdowns, and\nZook made a number of questionable calls that helped Michigan (No. 11 ESPN/USA Today; No. 12 Associated Press) to a 38-30 victory over Florida (No. 20 ESPN/USA Today; No. 22 Associated Press) in the Outback Bowl on\nWednesday.\n\n\t   Bulling through the middle and taking advantage of screen and\nswing passes galore, Perry accounted for 193 yards -- 85 rushing and\n108 receiving.\n\n\t   ''I wouldn't say it was my best game, but it was one of them,''\nhe said.\n\n\t   His last two touchdowns lifted the Wolverines (10-3) from a\ntwo-point deficit to a 35-23 lead in the third quarter, and from\nthere, Michigan held on -- with plenty of help from Zook.\n\n\t   Playing in possibly his last game for the Gators (8-5), junior Rex Grossman threw for 323 yards and two scores.\n\n\t   But with the game on the line, the Heisman Trophy\nrunner-up last season didn't have the ball in his hands. Instead, he was\nrunning a pass pattern.\n\n\t   With the Gators trailing 38-30 and moving downfield nicely with\na minute left, Zook called for a trick play from the Michigan 27.\n\n\t   Freshman cornerback-turned-receiver Vernell Brown took the ball\non a reverse and, under heavy pressure, lobbed a terrible pass\ndownfield that was intercepted by Victor Hobson to seal the\nvictory.\n\n\t   Grossman was the intended receiver, and Zook explained he would\nhave been open because the Wolverines were in man coverage.\n\n\t   ''I OK'd the play. I was on the headset,'' Zook said of the call\nthat came from offensive coordinator Ed Zaunbrecher.\n\n\t   ''We brought it up early in the series,'' Zook said. ''I asked,\n'Are you sure we want to do this?' We had worked on it. Sometimes\nit would work, sometimes it doesn't.''\n\n\t   Grossman, who still hasn't decided whether he'll return for his\nsenior season, said the play worked in practice all the time.\n\n<photo2>\n\n\t   ''It's a risky call,'' he said. ''But you can get some good\nrewards, too. It can go both ways.''\n\n\t   Hobson said he was shocked to see Brown, a high school\nquarterback who hadn't thrown a pass all season, making the key\nthrow of the game. Meanwhile, Michigan quarterback John Navarre\nstood on the sideline in shock.\n\n\t   ''I can't comment on coaching decisions because I'm not a\ncoach,'' Navarre said. ''You just never know how those kind of\nplays are going to work out.''\n\n\t   Of course, that play might have only masked another series of\nquestionable calls by Zook.\n\n\t   After Earnest Graham's touchdown gave the Gators a 13-7 lead in\nthe second quarter, Zook inexplicably called for a two-point\nconversion try out of an unbalanced set. It failed. Later, when the\nGators scored a touchdown to go ahead 22-21, Zook went for one, not two because, he said, ''it was too early.''\n\n\t   Thus, the Gators found themselves behind by eight points late,\ninstead of seven.\n\n\t   Grossman finished 21-for-41 and wasn't necessarily the best\nquarterback on the field. Navarre went 21-for-36 for 319 yards.\n\n\t   Nursing a 35-30 lead with five minutes left, Navarre hit Perry\non a screen for a 30-yard gain to set up a field goal.\n\n\t   The Gators hit the five-loss mark for the first time since 1989,\nthe year before Steve Spurrier took over the program and brought it\nto national prominence.\n\n\t   ''This is not up to the standard that's been set around here,''\nZook said. ''And it's not up to the standard we're going to have\naround here.''\n\n\t   Perry, who has been swapped in and out with B.J. Askew as\nMichigan's feature back throughout his career, broke the Michigan\nbowl record of three touchdowns held by six players, most recently\nDavid Terrell in the 2000 Orange Bowl.\n\n\t   Perry finished with 1,110 yards this season. His career has been\nspotty -- filled with good games, signs of huge potential and the\ncriticism that has come when he hasn't fulfilled it.\n\n\t   ''When you're at Michigan, if you're the tailback or the\nquarterback, for some people, it's just never good enough,'' coach\nLloyd Carr said. ''But he's good enough for me.''\n\n\t   Perry was hardly the only player to cause Florida problems.\n\n\t   Receiver Braylon Edwards caught four passes for 110 yards. Tight\nend Bennie Joppru had six catches for 80 yards. Askew, the team's\nmost valuable player this season, played the entire game even\nthough he broke his hand in the first quarter.\n\n\t   ''He said, 'Coach, I can't catch the ball, I can't run, but I\ncan block,''' Carr said. ''There's a story behind every player.''\n\t"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Big Ten -
