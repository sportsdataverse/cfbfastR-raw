href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/499960/james-lawson\" target=\"_new\">James Lawson</a> hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/532331/will-gay\" target=\"_new\">Will Gay</a> on a 66-yard touchdown pass and the defense made a goal-line stand as Wofford twice came from behind to beat Elon 31-27 on Saturday in a Southern Conference game.\n\nWofford (4-2, 3-0) was trailing 27-24 with 5:55 to go when Lawson threw the game-winner. On its next drive, Elon (2-5, 1-2) marched to within the Wofford 2 but was stopped on fourth and goal by a swarm of Terriers defenders as time ran out.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/515976/jonny-martin\" target=\"_new\">Jonny Martin</a> had scoring runs of 9 and 5 yards for Wofford and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/514372/octavius-harden\" target=\"_new\">Octavius Harden</a> tied the game 24-24 with a 23-yard TD run in the fourth quarter. Elon replied with a 25-yard field goal by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/548594/john-gallagher\" target=\"_new\">John Gallagher</a>, his second of the game, to retake the lead 27-24. Then Lawson connected with Gay.\n\nElon's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/499869/mike-quinn\" target=\"_new\">Mike Quinn</a> ran for one score, threw for two more and had 285 yards passing."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
