yards to set a conference record with 3,494 career yards.\n\nAfter two straight weeks of giving up more than 500 yards and a week after committing five turnovers, the defense stepped up and the offense was flawless for the Bulldogs (4-4, 2-1 Northeast Conference).\n\nWith help from the Dukes (4-3, 2-1), Bryant broke away from a 7-7 halftime tie with 35 unanswered points. Duquesne lost a fumble, had three interceptions and 322 yards in total offense, 86 on a final scoring drive.\n\nAfter the fumble recovery, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/502136/mike-westerhaus\" target=\"_new\">Mike Westerhaus</a> threw his second touchdown pass, a 7-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/531916/chad-ward\" target=\"_new\">Chad Ward</a>. Westerhaus finished with 160 yards, passing 4,000 for his career."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
