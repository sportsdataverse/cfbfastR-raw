quarter -- the breakaway run also breaking open a close game as Hampton defeated Delaware State 30-7 on Saturday.\n\nWith Hampton (3-5, 3-1 Mid-Eastern Athletic) leading only 10-7 at the half, the Pirates forced a Delaware State (3-5, 3-2) punt on the opening drive of the third quarter. One play and 13 seconds later, the rout was on as Washington rushed for more than half of his game-high 127 yards with the TD run.\n\nThe Pirate attack was balanced, with six players rushing the ball. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/551364/bryan-bailey\" target=\"_new\">Bryan Bailey</a> completed 9 of 16 passes for 112 yards, and in the fourth quarter hit <a
