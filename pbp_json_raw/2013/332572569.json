Saturday, and the offense turned a slow start into a strong finish, winning 32-0 and notching its first victory of the season.\n\nSC State defenders limited Alabama A&M (1-2, 1-0 SWAC) to minus 3 yards rushing, scored a safety, snagged two interceptions and recovered two fumbles. They kept AAMU bottled up for much of the game, limiting them to 194 yards of total offense.\n\nAfter a sputtering start, SC State's hurry-up offense kicked into gear, with a big play coming on a 72-yard touchdown pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/487587/richard-cue\" target=\"_new\">Richard Cue</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/506928/tyler-mcdonald\" target=\"_new\">Tyler McDonald</a> in the second quarter. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/530952/justin-taylor\" target=\"_new\">Justin Taylor</a> scored twice, on 15-yard run in the first quarter and on a 1-yard run in the third. <a
