almost unstoppable running the ball in the first half. The Raiders (4-6, 3-1 Patriot League) ran for 172 yards and four touchdowns by the intermission to go ahead 28-10 and compel some Lafayette fans to leave the stadium.\n\nThe Leopards (3-6, 3-1), however, shut out Colgate the rest of the way and scored 14 unanswered third quarter points to be in position with three fourth-quarter drives to win and clinch at least a share of the Patriot League title.\n\nThe Raiders stopped them each time and Russell finished with 92 yards for a victory that keeps Colgate, with Lafayette, in the title hunt.\n\n<a
