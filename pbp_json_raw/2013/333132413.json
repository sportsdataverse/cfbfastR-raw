Bell</a>, including a 70-yarder that gave San Diego a 21-0 lead in the second quarter. Mills, who was 23-of-31 passing, went over 3,000 yards for the season. Bell, with 211 yards on nine catches, went over 1,000 yards receiving for the year. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/537450/joe-ferguson\" target=\"_new\">Joe Ferguson</a>
