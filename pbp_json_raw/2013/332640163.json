href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/502355/brandon-bialkowski\" target=\"_new\">Brandon Bialkowski</a> threw for 430 yards and engineered four second-half scoring drives in Lehigh's 29-28 comeback victory over Princeton on Saturday night.\n\nAfter trailing 22-3 at half, Lehigh (3-0) took the lead early in the fourth quarter on a Bialkowski pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/512580/dylan-colgate\" target=\"_new\">Dylan Colgate</a> to go ahead 23-22.  Princeton answered with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/516528/connor-michelsen\" target=\"_new\">Connor Michelsen</a>'s 9-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/538219/di-andre-atwater\" target=\"_new\">Di Andre Atwater</a> which put the Tigers up 28-23 after a missed two-point conversion.\n\nLehigh then scored its game-winning touchdown on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/502361/sean-farrell\" target=\"_new\">Sean Farrell</a>'s 1-yard run with 2:45 left in the game.\n\nLehigh has needed to rally from behind in each of its three victories this season.\n\nPrinceton (0-1) succeeded early as a result of up-tempo play-calling and unique offensive sets. In some formations, the Tigers had three quarterbacks on the field. Co-quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/516520/quinn-epperly\" target=\"_new\">Quinn Epperly</a> was effective when he lined up next to Michelsen as a threat to run,
