href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/512298/ross-scheuerman\" target=\"_new\">Ross Scheuerman</a> produced a career-high 280 all-purpose yards and scored two touchdowns as Lafayette earned its first victory of the season with a 31-7 win over Bucknell on Saturday in the conference opener for both schools.\n\nScheuerman's career day provided more than enough offense for Leopards as Lafayette (1-3) held Bucknell (1-3) to just 80 yards of total offense.\n\nLafayette opened a 21-0 first-half lead on a Scheuerman touchdown run and two passing touchdowns by <a

href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/499337/charles-thompson\" target=\"_new\">Charles Thompson</a> in the second quarter to make the score 21-7.\n\nScheuerman totaled 188 yards rushing in the game, highlighted by his TD run of 78 yards, a career-long, to put Lafayette up 31-7 in the fourth quarter.\n\nBucknell was 3 of 17 on third-down conversions, and <a
