Austin in the season opener for both teams Saturday night.\n\nSmith's touchdown was part of a quick drive down the field in the fourth quarter that stifled the momentum of two touchdowns by SFA, which had narrowed the score to 43-40 early in the fourth quarter.\n\nWeber State took a 23-7 lead in the first quarter and managed to keep it.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/477325/bo-bolen\" target=\"_new\">Bo Bolen</a> had two of the Wildcats' four rushing touchdowns.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/486741/brady-attaway\" target=\"_new\">Brady Attaway</a> threw for 450 yards and four touchdowns to keep the Lumberjacks in the game.  Stephen F.

loss."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"Sacramento
