Baker</a> ran for two more as Western Illinois cruised to its second straight victory, defeating Quincy 34-6 on Saturday.\n\nBaker scored on a 43-yard run in the first quarter and the Fighting Leathernecks (2-0) of the Missouri Valley Conference were never headed. Baker also had a 9-yard TD run. Baker rushed for 144 yards on 14 carries.\n\nNorvell had touchdown passes of 25 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/548402/hi-c-scott\" target=\"_new\">Hi-C Scott</a> and 4 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/485779/kyle-robiskie\" target=\"_new\">Kyle Robiskie</a>. Norvell finished with 278 yards on 24-of-34 passing. WIU had 549 total yards, but also endured 160 yards in penalties.\n\nThe Western Illinois defense forced nine turnovers in a victory last week, but only got one against the Division II Hawks (0-1). Still, the Leathernecks forced Quincy, which depends heavily on its ground game, to go to the air. Quincy rushed for only 39 yards and passed for 224."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
