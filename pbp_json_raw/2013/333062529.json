first quarter.   <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/519287/julian-hayes\" target=\"_new\">Julian Hayes</a> tied the game with a 58-yard touchdown run just over three minutes

three plays later and, following a Sacred Heart turnover, forced a four-and-out on the ensuing drive.\n\nKevin Sperduto paced the Sacred Heart defense with 11 tackles, three for a loss, including 1
