href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/516690/lyle-negron\" target=\"_new\">Lyle Negron</a>'s second touchdown pass of the game lifted Stony Brook to a 21-13 win over Bryant, blunting a fourth-quarter Bulldogs rally on Saturday.\n\nThe win ended a three-game skid for Stony Brook (2-3), its longest since 2011. The Seawolves scored early on freshman Tyler Frederick's run from the 8, his first career TD, and led 14-7 after Negron's 63-yard TD pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/509946/adrian-coxson\" target=\"_new\">Adrian Coxson</a>, the longest pass play this season. Negron finished with 260 yards passing.\n\nBryant came within a point in the fourth quarter, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/502136/mike-westerhaus\" target=\"_new\">Mike Westerhaus</a> scoring on a keeper from the 13. Tyler Alberti missed the extra point, however. Stony Brook responded with a Negron touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/498446/devante-wheeler\" target=\"_new\">Devante Wheeler</a> for 41-yards and some breathing room with 9:15 to play. The drive was helped by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/501099/will-tye\" target=\"_new\">Will Tye</a>'s third-and-two conversion, dragging three Bryant tacklers for the first down. The game drew a LaValle Stadium-record crowd of 11,224."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
