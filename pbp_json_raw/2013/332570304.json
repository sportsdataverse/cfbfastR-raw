to a 29-3 win over Western State on Saturday.\n\nAfter amassing 439 yards passing for the Bengals (2-0) last week against Dixie State, Arias has now thrown for over 400 yards in each of Idaho State's two games this season.\n\nTrailing 13-3 early in the third quarter, Western State (0-2) had a chance to cut the lead to single digits when Kalvin Winter recovered a fumble at the Idaho State 3-yard line. But the Mountaineers failed to score after a fourth-down pass by Brett Arrivey was broken up.\n\nArias then led Idaho State on a 12-play, 99-yard scoring drive, culminating with a three-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/537175/tyler-wright\" target=\"_new\">Tyler Wright</a> to extend the Bengals' lead to 20-3.\n\n<a
