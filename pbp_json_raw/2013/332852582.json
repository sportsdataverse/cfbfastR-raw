Alabama A&M 20-17 in double overtime on Saturday night.\n\nA 90-minute lightning delay with 3:27 remaining in regulation set up the roller coaster conclusion.\n\nWhen play resumed, Alabama A&M faced a third-and-one on the Southern 27 down 14-10. The Bulldogs went ahead on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/518589/brandon-wells\" target=\"_new\">Brandon Wells</a>' 4-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/504474/toriono-upshaw\" target=\"_new\">Toriono Upshaw</a> with 49 seconds to go.\n\nSouthern (3-3, 3-1 Southwestern Athletic Conference) quickly responded, driving to the Alabama A&M 5. An intentional grounding penalty set up Hill's first field goal to tie the game at 17 as time expired.\n\nHill missed his next attempt in the first possession of overtime, but the Bulldogs (2-5, 2-3) fumbled and the Jaguars recovered to end the first overtime.\n\nCaesar Ramon missed from 37 and Hill redeemed himself with the game winner in second overtime."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Southwestern Athletic -
