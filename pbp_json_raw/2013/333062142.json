Williams' fourth quarter touchdown rush from three yards out sealed Bucknell's 28-7 win over Colgate.\n\nThe win breaks the Bison's 6-game losing streak to the Raiders.\n\nBucknell (4-4, 2-2) broke out 10-0, with a <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/513218/derek-maurer\" target=\"_new\">Derek Maurer</a> 28-yard field goal and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/499342/brandon-wesley\" target=\"_new\">Brandon Wesley</a>'s second quarter 1-yard scoring plunge.\n\nColgate (3-6, 2-1) answered on its next drive with a 35-yard scoring strike from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/499343/gavin-mccarney\" target=\"_new\">Gavin McCarney</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/515054/kevin-oconnell\" target=\"_new\">Kevin O'Connell</a> to cut the score to 10-7.\n\nBut Bucknell took over in the second half. They turned a third quarter Colgate fumble into a 23-yard Maurer field goal, then extended its lead early in the fourth, with an 80-yard drive finished by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/532826/matt-delmauro\" target=\"_new\">Matt DelMauro</a>'s 2-yard touchdown rush and Wesley's keeper for the two-point conversion.\n\nAfter the kickoff, McCarney was picked off by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/513217/lee-marvel\" target=\"_new\">Lee Marvel</a> who returned to the Colgate 12, setting up Williams'
