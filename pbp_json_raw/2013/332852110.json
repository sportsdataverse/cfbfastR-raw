total offense.\n\nNo player scored more than one touchdown for Bears, who used three quarterbacks, seven different rushers and twelve players caught a pass.\n\nA field goal followed by a rushing touchdown from Smothers built an early 10-0 lead for Central Arkansas, and a pair of third-quarter touchdowns extended the lead to 24-0.\n\n<a
