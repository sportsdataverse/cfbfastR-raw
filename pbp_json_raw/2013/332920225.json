come-from-behind victory over Brown Saturday night.\n\nEpperly also led the Tigers (4-1, 2-0 Ivy) in rushing with 95 yards.\n\nBrown (3-2, 0-2) took a 17-0 lead early in the second quarter when defensive back Jacob Spuron blocked a Princeton punt. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/529769/michael-walsh\" target=\"_new\">Michael Walsh</a> returned it 18 yards for a Bears touchdown.\n\nEpperly responded at the opening of the second half by taking the Tigers 79 yards and over the goal line for a Princeton score. The Brown defense anticipated the 2-point conversion attempt, breaking up Epperly's pass to wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/502604/roman-wilson\" target=\"_new\">Roman Wilson</a> and putting the halftime score at 17-6.\n\nBut the Princeton scoring run would continue unabated in the second half with 5 more unanswered TDs -- including three
