win in the series against Presbyterian (1-4).\n\nAfter Wofford opened a 14-0 lead, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/514079/kaleb-griffin\" target=\"_new\">Kaleb Griffin</a>'s

responded with six unanswered TDs.\n\nNo Wofford rusher scored more than once, but four Terriers rushed for at least 70 yards to provide Wofford with a balanced run game.\n\nThe Terriers intercepted Presbyterian three times, and held the Blue Hose to just 187 yards of total offense. Wofford's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/532346/hunter-thurley\" target=\"_new\">Hunter Thurley</a> returned one of the three interceptions 36 yards for a touchdown.\n\n<a
