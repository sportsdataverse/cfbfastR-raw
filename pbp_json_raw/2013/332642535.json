victory over Samford Saturday.\n\nSamford (2-2), trailing 34-14 in the fourth quarter, capped a 17-point come back, to pull within three, on an <a

quarter. They recovered the kick and drove 56 yards in 13 plays to take a 10-7 lead on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/549521/kody-sutton\" target=\"_new\">Kody Sutton</a>'s 1-yard run. They never trailed after that, taking a 24-7 lead into the locker room.\n\nSutton finished the day with two touchdowns on 100 yards rushing.\n\nSamford took an early lead on a Summerlin's 4 yard pass
