dominating 45-0 win over Rhode Island.\n\nRobertson, who needed just 32 yards to break the school rushing record for a  quarterback, got that and a whole lot more as he had 133 yards rushing on just 12 carries before leaving the game midway of the third quarter. He tied his career high with four touchdowns rushing.  He also threw for 179 yards.\n\nThe sophomore now has 2,262 career yards rushing.  That ranks him fourth for all rushers at the school. Robertson has rushed for 1,240 yards this season.\n\nThis was the first shut out for Villanova (5-5, 4-3 Colonial Athletic Association) since blanking Lehigh 35-0 on September 11, 2010. Villanova's defense stymied Rhode Island (3-8, 2-5 CAA), allowing only 88 yards of total offense."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
