four scores to beat defending Ivy league champion Penn 38-26 on Saturday.\n\nThe comeback win moved the Tigers (7-1, 5-0 Ivy) closer to their first league title since 2006, putting them a game up on Harvard with two to play.\n\nPenn (4-4, 3-2), which has won three of the last four championships, took a 16-0 lead on a safety, followed by Sam Chwarzynzki's 61-yard return after intercepting Epperly and a <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/516511/kyle-wilcox\" target=\"_new\">Kyle Wilcox</a> rushing TD. But Princeton rallied for 17 straight points before halftime.\n\nIn the second half Epperly rushed for two TDs and passed for another, finishing with 268 yards passing and a team-best 53 rushing as Princeton pulled away.\n\nPenn's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/483777/billy-ragone\" target=\"_new\">Billy Ragone</a> threw for 168 yards and a TD, but was intercepted three times.
