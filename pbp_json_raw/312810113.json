Quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=502227\" target=\"_new\">Gunnar Jespersen</a> had pulled Central Connecticut (2-4) within 28-26 on a short touchdown pass to tight end <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=502219\" target=\"_new\">Raul DeBenendittis</a>. The two-point conversion attempt failed. Then Julmiste returned the ensuing kickoff 90 yards for a touchdown.\n\nOn the next Blue Devils possession, Jespersen was picked off by Thellen. He returned his second interception of the evening 85 yards for a touchdown. Those 14 unanswered points spoiled an otherwise good night for Jespersen, who also ran for 93 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nIn his second start, UMass quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=498493\" target=\"_new\">Brandon Hill</a> hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=237818\" target=\"_new\">Emil
