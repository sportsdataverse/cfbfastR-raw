remained unbeaten by humbling Indiana State, 56-6, Saturday afternoon.\n\nStreveler now has accounted for 25 touchdowns through six games.\n\nThe Sycamores scored first on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4051898/jerry-nunez\" target=\"_new\">Jerry Nunez</a>'s 35-yard field goal to cap a 13-play drive to open the game, but Streveler answered with the first of two touchdown passes to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3120769/brandt-van-roekel\" target=\"_new\">Brandt Van Roekel</a> on the ensuing drive. Nunez converted from 20-yards out to cut the Coyotes' lead to a single point, but Streveler found Van Roekel with a 55-yard strike to make it 14-6.\n\nSouth Dakota (6-0, 3-0 Missouri Valley) led 28-6 at intermission.\n\nStreveler completed 27 of 32 pass attempts for 337 yards. He has yet to commit a turnover this season.\n\nIndiana State (0-6, 0-3) has a total of 10 touchdowns this season and remains winless under first-year head coach Curt Mallory.\n\n---\n\nMore AP
