After three straight incompletions from their own 20, the Eagles lined up to punt, but the snap sailed over the head of Cameron Zuber and out of the end zone for a safety with 1:08 to go.\n\nWeber State made the most of good field position on the ensuing kickoff, with Higgins completing passes of 12 yards to Smith and 11 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=152399\">Tim Toone</a> to push the ball to the Eastern Washington 30. From there, Higgins hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187105\">Mike Phillips</a> on a floater in the end zone with 32 seconds left for a 22-7 edge.\n\nIt was one of two TD receptions for Phillips, who also caught an 80-yarder from Higgins. Toone finished with seven receptions for 52 yards for Weber State, becoming only the sixth player in Big Sky history to eclipse 3,000 yards receiving for his career. Ryan Eastman had three sacks for the Wildcats.\n\nEastern Washington's Nichols completed 24 of 39 but was picked off three times, snapping his string of 151 passes without an interception.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171146\">Tony Davis</a> caught six passes for 131 yards and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233336\">Taiwan Jones</a> added 64 yards rushing for the Eagles. J.C. Sherritt ran back an interception 36 yards for a touchdown and had 24 tackles for Eastern Washington."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
