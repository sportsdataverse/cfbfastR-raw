touchdown reception with 1:03 left in the game, and Bucknell beat Marist 21-17 on Saturday.\n\nTrailing 17-14 with 2:47 left in the game, Bucknell came up with a defensive stop but was pinned deep in their own territory at the 6-yard line. Trigg then engineered a 94-yard game-winning drive for the Bisons.\n\nTrigg threw for 217 yards and two touchdowns. Pasternak caught six passes for 100 yards.\n\nMarist (2-4) was in control with 21 seconds remaining in the third quarter leading 17-7, but the Bucknell (3-1) defense clamped down and did not allow the Red Foxes score again.\n\nMarist's Obozua Ehikioya ran for 156 yards and exploded for an 80-yard touchdown run on the first play from scrimmage following an unsuccessful fake field-goal attempt on the Bisons' opening drive of the game.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171535\">Alex Odenbach</a> chipped in with six catches for 62 yards and a touchdown for
