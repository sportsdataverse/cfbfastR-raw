run and pushed that lead to 13-0 after Lefall's first touchdown run, an 18-yarder.\n\nHampton (2-6, 2-4) scored 10 unanswered points to cut the deficit to 13-10 but Lefall's fourth quarter touchdown sealed the win for the Bison.\n\nLefall finished with 182 yards on 37 carries. Liggins struggled throwing the ball, completing just 6 of 12 passes, but added 27 yards on the ground.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/537149/brian-swain\" target=\"_new\">Brian Swain</a> posted 105 yards on 14 carries, 91 yards through the air and accounted for the Hampton's only touchdown of the day.
