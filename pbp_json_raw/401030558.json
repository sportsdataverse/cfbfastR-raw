attempt on the final play to give Bernard Clark his first win as the Colonials' head coach, 22-19 over Virginia State on Saturday.\n\nThe Division-II Trojans drove 79 yards to the Robert Morris 3 before the Colonials (1-1) blocked their second field goal attempt of the game to win after trailing 19-7 with under nine minutes remaining.\n\nDemetrius Strickland's 7-yard run gave the Trojans a 12-7 third-quarter lead that stretched to 12 points after Adonte Braxton recovered a fumble in the end zone.\n\nWalker was only 9-of-21 passing with two interceptions, but in the fourth quarter he found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4038098/matthew-gonzalez\" target=\"_new\">Matthew Gonzalez</a> alone on the right sideline for an 81-yard touchdown and, following a
