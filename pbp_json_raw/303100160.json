Colonial Athletic Association game.\n\nThe Tribe (7-2, 5-1) won their eighth in a row against New Hampshire (5-4, 3-3) and have won 12 of 14 in the series overall.\n\nGrimes bounced back from a tough game last week, when he had only 23 rushing yards at North Carolina. The Tribe beat New Hampshire with defense, holding the Wildcats to 179 total yards.\n\nTheir other touchdown came in the second quarter, when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=484752\" target=\"_new\">Brent Caprio</a> connected with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185451\" target=\"_new\">Chase Hill</a> on a 19-yard pass.\n\nThe victory ensured that William & Mary will maintain at least a share of first place in the NEC. The Tribe was tied for the conference lead with Villanova, which played at Rhode Island, and Delaware, which hosted Towson, going into Saturday's games."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
