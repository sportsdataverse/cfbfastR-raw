yards.\n\nTwo of O'Dell's touchdowns came in the last 2:18 of the first half, and put Dayton (6-1, 2-1 Pioneer Football League) ahead 21-14. Davidson (3-3, 1-2) evened it up in the third quarter with a 14-play, 73-yard drive that ended on a 2-yard <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234685\">Kenny Mantuo</a> run.\n\nTwo minutes later, Hoyng threw his fourth touchdown of the game -- a 13-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=151064\">Nick Ruhe</a> -- and Dayton stayed in front from there.\n\nHoyng was 25-for-40 with one interception. He also rushed for 77 yards on 15 carries, and his 408 passing yards were the third-most ever for a Dayton quarterback. Ruhe led Flyers receivers with nine receptions for 160 yards.\n\nDavidson's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159949\">Ryan Hubbard</a> had 10 catches for 138 yards, while
