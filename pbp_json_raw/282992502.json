href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234074\">Drew Hubel</a> passed for 474 yards and three touchdowns to lead Portland State to a 36-13 victory in Big Sky Conference action on Saturday.\n\nAfter playing a solid first half, Idaho State trailed only 16-13 late in the third quarter. But Portland State mounted a long drive that ended with a 36-yard field goal by Danny Urrego and the Vikings had a six-point lead.\n\nThe turning point of the game came when the Bengals fumbled away the ensuing kickoff. One play later, Hubel found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188115\">Raymond Fry</a> for a 28-yard touchdown pass. In a span of 15 seconds, Portland State had turned a close game into a comfortable 26-13 advantage.\n\nWith their next possession, the Bengals moved almost the length of the field. But the drive sputtered deep in Portland State territory and a fourth-down pass by Idaho State quarterback Russell Hill wound up falling incomplete after hitting two Bengal receivers.\n\nOn the next play, Fry took a screen pass 72 yards and Portland State was back in business at the Bengals' 23. The Vikings had to settle for Urrego's 23-yard field goal but pushed their lead to 29-13 with 13:36 left.\n\nThe final blow came four minutes later when Portland State defensive back Reggie Jones returned an interception 33 yards for a touchdown and a 36-13 lead.\n\nHill finished the game 25 of 47 for 276 yards but he also threw two interceptions.\n\nHubel, who set a school record three weeks ago with 623 yards, picked up his fourth career 400-yard game. Fry was his leading receiver with six catches for 164 yards. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=235306\">Aaron Woods</a> added six catches for 110 yards.\n\nPortland State (3-4) remained unbeaten at home this season, but is winless on the road. Idaho State dropped to 0-8 and its next three opponents (Cal Poly, Weber State and Montana) are all nationally ranked."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
