(AP) -- Cleveland McCoy passed for two touchdowns, propelling South Carolina State to a 24-13 win over Bethune-Cookman Saturday.\n\nSCSU took the early lead (1-0) in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference standings, while Bethune-Cookman fell to 0-1 in the league and 1-1 overall.\n\nMcCoy threw an 11-yard strike to Spencer Miller early in the third quarter and a 49-yarder to Oliver Young in the fourth quarter. McCoy completed 10 of 18 passes for 88 yards and rushed seven times for 66 yards, as did teammate Travil Jamison.\n\nThe Bulldogs jumped to 10-0 midway through the first quarter. Stephen Grantham nailed a 35-yard field goal at 12:28 for the initial score.\n\nBethune-Cookman's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161582\">Jimmie Russell</a> pitched errantly toward <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=174717\">Corey Council</a> on an option play at the 26-yard line, with SCSU's LaQuinn Ellerbe grabbing the ball and racing 23 yards before being stopped at the 3-yard line.\n\nJamison then plunged across the goal line. Grantham's extra-point kick at 7:32 made it 10-0.\n\nBethune-Cookman's 83-yard, 17-play drive produced a 24-yard field goal by Lucas Esquivel at 4:24 of the second quarter.\n\nAnother Russell pitch, recovered by SCSU's Bailey Brinson at 31-yard line, led to McCoy's first TD toss and a 17-3 lead.\n\nCouncil's 98-yard kickoff return and Esquivel's 27-yard field goal -- both in the third quarter -- cut the Bulldog advantage to 17-13.\n\nThen came McCoy's second TD toss, which sealed the victory."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"South Carolina State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2569/south-carolina-state","id":"2569","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2569","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"7-5","displayValue":"7-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"5-0","displayValue":"5-0"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2569.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"North Carolina Central","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2428/north-carolina-central","id":"2428","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2428","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"6-5","displayValue":"6-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"4-1","displayValue":"4-1"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2428.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Delaware State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2169/delaware-state","id":"2169","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2169","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"5-6","displayValue":"5-6"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"2-3","displayValue":"2-3"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2169.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Norfolk State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2450/norfolk-state","id":"2450","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2450","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"6-5","displayValue":"6-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"2-3","displayValue":"2-3"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2450.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Howard","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/47/howard","id":"47","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:47","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"3-8","displayValue":"3-8"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"1-4","displayValue":"1-4"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/47.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Morgan State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2415/morgan-state","id":"2415","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2415","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"2-9","displayValue":"2-9"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"1-4","displayValue":"1-4"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2415.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]}]},"header":"2021 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Standings"},{"divisions":[{"header":"Southwestern Athletic -
