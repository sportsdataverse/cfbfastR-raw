(AP) -- Running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161983\">Tyler Roehl</a> returned to the North Dakota State lineup after a forced layoff to rush for 257 yards and four touchdowns in a 54-28 win over Illinois State Saturday.\n\nBison coaches held out Roehl -- over his objections -- last week because of a sore shoulder suffered during a school-record 263-yard performance against Minnesota. He looked rested against the Redbirds.\n\nRoehl's 257 yards were the most ever given up by an Illinois State team. He went over 200 yards for the third time this season and scored more than two touchdowns for the fourth time this year.\n\nSenior quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=153590\">Steve Walker</a>, playing his final home game, threw a pair of touchdown passes to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162014\">Kole Heckendorf</a> and added a 1-yard touchdown run for NDSU (9-0, 2-0 Great West Football Conference).\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159940\">Luke Drone</a> tossed three touchdown passes for Illinois State (4-6, 2-3 Gateway Football Conference).\n\nThe teams combined for 1,024 yards of total offense, including a season-high 627 yards by the No. 1-ranked Bison and 397 yards for the Redbirds.\n\nRoehl gained 174 yards in the first half, 81 of those coming on his third touchdown run of the night to make it 33-14 with 9:11 left in the second quarter. It was his longest run of the season.\n\nNDSU gave the Redbirds an easy touchdown in the final seconds of the first half. Punter Mike Dragosavich muffed a snap at his own 10-yard line, then kicked the ball at the 2 out of the back of his own end zone. That drew a penalty for illegal touching, giving the Redbirds the ball at the NDSU 1.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=146199\">Rafael Price</a> scored from there, with 6 seconds showing, to make it 33-21 at half.\n\nThe Bison took the second-half kickoff and drove eight yards in 76 plays, culminated by a 14-yard touchdown pass from Walker to Heckendorf. It was the fifth time NDSU scored on its first possession after intermission.\n\nThe Redbirds could get no closer than 12 points in the second half."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"North Dakota
