Toman</a> threw for 257 yards as No. 10 New Hampshire defeated No. 9 Southern Illinois 29-20 in the first round of the Football Championship Subdivision playoffs.\n\nNew Hampshire (10-2) capitalized on three SIU turnovers and a blocked punt return for a touchdown to advance to its fourth second-round playoff appearance since 2004.\n\nWith the game tight at 19-13 in the last minutes of the third quarter, New Hampshire defensive back John Clements returned a blocked SIU punt 26 yards to put New Hampshire up 26-13 heading into the final quarter.\n\nSIU quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187992\">Chris Dieker</a> answered with a 30-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Haruff to come within a score, but Kicker Tom Bishop iced the game with a 32-yard field goal, his fifth on the day.\n\nBishop?s five field goals tied the Division I playoff record set previously by Fordham in 2002 and Western Illinois in 2003.\n\nBishop and the Wildcats were given a short field on many scores because of SIU turnovers. Dieker, who finished with 163 yards, threw two interceptions and running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234663\">Larry Warner</a> recorded a costly fumble on an early Saluki drive to set up a New Hampshire score.\n\nNew Hampshire wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=163807\">Mike Boyle</a> finished with 131 yards. Nearly half of those yards came on a 54-yard reception late in the second quarter that set Toman up for a two-yard rushing touchdown to put the Wildcats up 16-13 at the half.\n\nThe loss was Southern Illinois? first at home since last season?s semifinal playoff defeat against Delaware."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
