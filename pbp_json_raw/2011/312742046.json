seconds left to give Austin Peay a 37-34 win over Tennessee State on Saturday.\n\nOn the previous possession, Tennessee State's Mike German threw an 8-yard pass to <a

However, the ball was stripped by Austin Peay's Amius Smith at the Governors' 47.\n\nAustin Peay then put together two first downs before going for a field goal on the Tigers' 18.\n\n<a
