the third quarter. Then Jeremy Kimbrough intercepted a pass and returned it 46 yards for a score with 13:38 to play, giving the Mountaineers a 14-6 lead.\n\nThe Mocs (2-2) pulled to within 14-12 on a 20-yard touchdown pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236000\" target=\"_new\">B.J.
