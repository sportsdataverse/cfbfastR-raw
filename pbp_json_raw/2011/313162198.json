Lamb passed for two scores and ran for a third as the Golden Eagles (6-3, 5-2) moved into a tie atop the OVC with Eastern Kentucky (6-4, 5-2).\n\nThe loss ended a five-game winning streak for Eastern Kentucky, which managed just 194 total yards. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/379745/hb-banjoman\" target=\"_new\">H.B. Banjoman</a> ran 1 yard for the Colonels' first touchdown before Lamb warmed up. His two scoring passes came in the second quarter, to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/486313/zack-ziegler\" target=\"_new\">Zack Ziegler</a> for 6 yards and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/486783/cody-matthews\" target=\"_new\">Cody Matthews</a> for 16.

That set up Lamb's game-winning play. With 6:35 left, he scored from the 4 and Tennessee Tech held on."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
