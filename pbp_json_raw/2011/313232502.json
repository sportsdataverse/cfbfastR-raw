Tuckett</a> rushed for 211 yards and five touchdowns to lead Weber State to a 48-33 victory over Portland State on Saturday.\n\nTuckett, who's listed as the second-string running back, got off to an impressive start when he ran for a 53-yard score on a fourth-down play to give Weber State (5-6, 5-3 Big Sky) a 7-0 lead. He scored again just before halftime, on a 1-yard run, to put the Wildcats in front of Portland State (7-4, 5-3) 27-20.\n\nAfter a slow third quarter, the junior broke loose for three touchdowns in the final period.\n\nTuckett's fourth and fifth touchdown runs broke open what had been a close game, which featured four ties and four lead changes.\n\nPortland State quarterback <a
