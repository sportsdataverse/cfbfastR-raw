Quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486056/jamal-jackson\" target=\"_new\">Jamal Jackson</a>, making his first start in place of the injured <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=381870/deandre-presley\" target=\"_new\">DeAndre Presley</a>, completed his first 15 passes and finished 21-for-27 for 234 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nA 28-yard scoring pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234141/brian-quick\" target=\"_new\">Brian Quick</a> was the 25th touchdown catch of Quick's career, tying the school record.\n\nWith Tavaris Cadet rushing for 133 yards and a touchdown, Appalachian State's eighth straight win over The Citadel seemed secure. But the Bulldogs (2-4, 1-4) rallied for 28 unanswered points with the aid of two Appalachian State fumbles and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486245/domonic-jones\"
