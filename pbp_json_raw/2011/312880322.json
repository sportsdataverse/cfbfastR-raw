held off Yale 28-19 on Saturday night.\n\nShoop, who finished 17 of 21 passing for 176 yards, threw a 7-yard TD to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=478661/kyle-hayes\"

left. Four minutes later, though, O'Neil scampered 6 yards for the game's final score to seal it for the Leopards.\n\nO'Neil was also 5 of 7 passing for 29 yards.\n\nWitt was 18 of 40 for 270 yards, two
