31-0 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference victory on a cold and rainy Saturday.\n\nThe Bulldogs (5-4, 4-2) got on the board quickly with a field goal on their opening possession. After the South Carolina State defense recovered a fumble deep in Howard (4-5, 3-3) territory, Asheton Thomas scored on a 2-yard run.

After neither team scored in the second and third quarters, Cue resumed control, this time with his feet. He ran for two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, including a 71-yarder. The South Carolina State defense, meanwhile, refused to yield.
