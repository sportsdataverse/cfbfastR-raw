left gave Coastal Carolina a 15-8 victory over Presbyterian Saturday night in Big South action.\n\nThe Chanticleers (5-4, 2-3) held Presbyterian (2-7, 1-3) without a touchdown and ended a three-game losing streak. But it wasn't easy.

But Childers, just 2 for 14 passing, hit Bennett for the game-winner with 4:48 left.
