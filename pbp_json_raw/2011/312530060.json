on to beat Morehouse 30-27 on Saturday.\n\nThe Bison were led by quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=519005\" target=\"_new\">Greg McGhee</a>, who threw for three touchdowns. He finished with 248 yards on 22 of 29 attempts.\n\nHoward took a 30-20 lead on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=480138\" target=\"_new\">Charles Brice</a>'s 17-yard run with 6 minutes to play.\n\nThe Maroon Tigers cut the deficit to three when Latavius Watts returned a Brice fumble 15 yards for a touchdown. Morehouse got one final shot at the win but Howard stopped the Maroon Tigers on their final drive, sacking Byron Ingram as time expired.\n\nMorehouse running back David Carter finished with 127 yards on 10 carries.\n\nIt was the first meeting between the prestigious Historically Black Colleges and Universities schools since 1997. The win marked Howard's fourth straight over Morehouse in the 88-year rivalry between the schools."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"South Carolina State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2569/south-carolina-state","id":"2569","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2569","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"7-5","displayValue":"7-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"5-0","displayValue":"5-0"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2569.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"North Carolina Central","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2428/north-carolina-central","id":"2428","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2428","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"6-5","displayValue":"6-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"4-1","displayValue":"4-1"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2428.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Delaware State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2169/delaware-state","id":"2169","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2169","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"5-6","displayValue":"5-6"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"2-3","displayValue":"2-3"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2169.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Norfolk State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2450/norfolk-state","id":"2450","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2450","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"6-5","displayValue":"6-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"2-3","displayValue":"2-3"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2450.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Howard","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/47/howard","id":"47","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:47","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"3-8","displayValue":"3-8"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"1-4","displayValue":"1-4"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/47.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Morgan State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2415/morgan-state","id":"2415","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2415","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"2-9","displayValue":"2-9"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"1-4","displayValue":"1-4"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2415.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]}]},"header":"2021 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Standings"}]}}
