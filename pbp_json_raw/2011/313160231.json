straight over Furman (6-4, 5-3). Elon had 442 yards total offense, 111 rushing by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/233762/aj-harris\" target=\"_new\">A.J. Harris</a>.

The big catch, a 55-yarder, put Elon ahead for good 34-27. Jones, who had 13 tackles, then made what proved to be the game-winning play.\n\nHe intercepted a <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/235906/chris-forcier\" target=\"_new\">Chris Forcier</a> pass and returned it 40 yards for a touchdown.
