Wofford remained undefeated in Southern Conference play with a 43-14 road route of The Citadel Saturday. The Terriers (4-1, 3-0) scored twice in each of the first two quarters to take a 28-0 halftime lead over the Bulldogs (2-3, 1-3).\n\nWofford led 43-0 in the fourth quarter before The Citadel finally scored. Those touchdowns came on short runs by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=499741\" target=\"_new\">Terrance Martin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486225\" target=\"_new\">Byron Addison</a>. By then, Wofford had shredded The Citadel's defense with a relentless, time-consuming running attack. Six Terriers ran for touchdowns.\n\nWofford drove 73 yards in 13 plays to open the game, culminating in <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234576\" target=\"_new\">Mitch Allen</a>'s 5-yard touchdown. When <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=380549\" target=\"_new\">Brenton Bersin</a> returned a punt 76 yards for a score, the rout was on. The Terriers later went 99 yards in 10 plays to score, followed by an 82-yard touchdown drive before The Citadel got on the board."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
