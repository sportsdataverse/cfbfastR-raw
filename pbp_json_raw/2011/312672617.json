Austin 35-26.\n\nRutherford, who once backed up future Heisman Trophy winner Cam Newton at Blinn College, completed only 10 passes, but for 241 yards. He also had 82 yards rushing for the Bobcats (2-2), scoring on a 22-yard scamper with 2:30 left to seal the win. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=386205\" target=\"_new\">Marcus Curry</a> added 128 yards on the ground.\n\nStephen F. Austin (1-3), which got a 100-yard kickoff return score from Graly Crawford, had pulled within 28-26 on a 49-yard interception return by Josh Aubrey, Rutherford's only miscue of the night. But <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486741\" target=\"_new\">Brady Attaway</a> misfired on the two-point conversion attempt that would have tied the game.\n\nAttaway attempted an astonishing 64 passes, completing 32 of them for 353 yards and an interception. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=513779\" target=\"_new\">Fred Ford</a> ran for a touchdown for the Lumberjacks."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Sun Belt -
