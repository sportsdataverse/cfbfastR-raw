lift Gardner-Webb to a 26-24 win over Coastal Carolina on Saturday night.\n\nThe winning kick was set up by a personal foul celebration penalty on the Chanticleers after an 86-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by Tre Henderson gave them a 24-23 lead with 1:51 to play. Facemask and late-hit personal foul penalties on the ensuing kickoff return gave Gardner-Webb first down at the Coastal Carolina 14-yard-line.\n\nThe win snapped a five-game losing streak for the Bulldogs (2-5, 1-2 Big South Conference), who had lost seven straight to the Chanticleers.\n\nTouchdown receptions of 20 and 5 yards by James \"Pork Chop\" Dugas gave Gardner-Webb a 20-10 lead after three quarters.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486941/travis-small\" target=\"_new\">Travis Small</a> scored on a 2-yard run for the Chanticleers (4-3, 1-2), then a
