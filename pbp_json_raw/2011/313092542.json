rout over Savannah State on Saturday.\n\nThe Spartans (8-2, 6-1 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference) outgained the Tigers by 514 yards of total offense (559-45).\n\nSavannah State (1-8, 1-5) was held to 0 for 12 on third-down tries, and never made a red zone appearance.\n\nNorfolk State clinched a share of the MEAC title with the win, coupled with Morgan State's 49-23 loss to Bethune-Cookman. It's Norfolk State's first conference football title since winning the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association championship in 1984.\n\nWalley torched the Tigers with 271 yards on 20 of 25 passing, and added 72 yards rushing on four carries. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/485164/derrick-demps\" target=\"_new\">Derrick Demps</a> was Walley's receiver of choice with five catches for 106 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nNorfolk State came just 20 yards shy of last year's record-setting offensive performance against Savannah State."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"South Carolina State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2569/south-carolina-state","id":"2569","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2569","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"7-5","displayValue":"7-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"5-0","displayValue":"5-0"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2569.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"North Carolina Central","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2428/north-carolina-central","id":"2428","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2428","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"6-5","displayValue":"6-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"4-1","displayValue":"4-1"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2428.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Delaware State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2169/delaware-state","id":"2169","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2169","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"5-6","displayValue":"5-6"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"2-3","displayValue":"2-3"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2169.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Norfolk State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2450/norfolk-state","id":"2450","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2450","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"6-5","displayValue":"6-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"2-3","displayValue":"2-3"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2450.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Howard","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/47/howard","id":"47","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:47","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"3-8","displayValue":"3-8"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"1-4","displayValue":"1-4"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/47.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Morgan State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2415/morgan-state","id":"2415","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2415","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"2-9","displayValue":"2-9"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"1-4","displayValue":"1-4"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2415.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]}]},"header":"2021 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Standings"},{"divisions":[{"header":"SIAC -
