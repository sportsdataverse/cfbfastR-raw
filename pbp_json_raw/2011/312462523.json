nine games in a 19-13 victory Saturday in the season opener for both teams.\n\nThe Flyers, who won a share of the Pioneer Football League title year ago, have not allowed more than 14 points in a game to the Colonials during the streak. Dayton's defense made the difference Saturday, forcing two turnovers and sacking Robert Morris quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=485167\" target=\"_new\">Jeff Sinclair</a> eight times.\n\nDayton also struggled offensively and was outgained by the Colonials of the Northeast Conference 237 yards to 233. A 5-yard run by Sinclair gave the Colonials a 7-6 lead in the second quarter, but Dayton responded with 13 straight points. A 27-yard pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=499537\" target=\"_new\">Will Bardo</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=387435\" target=\"_new\">Luke Bellman</a> and two field goals from Nate Miller gave the Flyers a 19-7 lead. Robert Morris' only other score came on a 1-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=240572\" target=\"_new\">Jamar Cromwell</a> with 5:54 to
