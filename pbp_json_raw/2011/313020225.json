home shutout for the first time since 1985.\n\nNorocea withstood driving rain to kick a 39-yard field goal in the second quarter and a 42-yarder as time expired in the third for Brown, which has won five in a row.\n\nPenn (4-3, 3-1) had a four-game winning streak snapped and was shut out for the first time since losing to Harvard on Nov. 15, 1997.\n\nThe sloppy conditions were a factor as both teams managed less than 200 yards total offense. Penn turned the ball over five times, including three interceptions by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/483777/billy-ragone\" target=\"_new\">Billy Ragone</a>, and was held to 32 yards passing.
