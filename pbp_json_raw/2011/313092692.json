href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/487403/denarius-mcghee\" target=\"_new\">DeNarius McGhee</a> threw for 310 yards and three touchdowns as Montana State continued its dominance over Weber State with a 44-24 victory at Stewart Stadium Saturday. The Bobcats have won seven straight in Ogden dating back to 1996 and 13 of the last 15 in the series.\n\nMcGhee was intercepted on his first two pass attempts of the game and No. 2 Montana State (9-1, 7-0 Big Sky) turned the ball over four times in the first half, but the Bobcats scored 24 unanswered points in a second half in which Weber State (3-6, 3-3) was held scoreless.\n\nThe Bobcats have a bye next week and will be undefeated in conference play when they take on in-state rival Montana in the annual Brawl of the Wild on Nov. 19.\n\n<a
