Military Academy 42-14 on Saturday.\n\nEssington was 18 of 23 for 255 yards and scored on a 1-yard run to open a 28-point streak by the Seawolves (4-3, 2-0 Big South Conference), which started with 21 seconds left in the second quarter.\n\nWhile Stony Brook had little trouble scoring -- taking a 28-0 lead on Grant Nakwaasah's 29-yard fumble return -- offense was hard to come by for the Keydets (1-6, 1-2).\n\nVMI totaled just 267 yards of offense, with only 38 coming on the ground. Stony Brook's defense allowed just three drives to go longer than five plays, and forced the Keydets to punt 11 times.\n\nVMI's only scores came on an 81-yard pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=484384/adam-morgan\" target=\"_new\">Adam Morgan</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=477309/aaron-lewis\"
