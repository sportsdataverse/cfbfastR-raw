B.W. Webb, put the Tribe on the New Haven 35. William & Mary then used eight plays to go 31 yards, as Kuhn made a 21-yard field goal as time expired in the first half to tie the score at 3-3.\n\nWilliam & Mary's third and final interception came in its own territory as the Chargers were driving for a potential winning score. On third-and-13 from the Tribe's 21, New Haven's Ryan Osiecki was picked off by Jabrel Mines.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=380816\" target=\"_new\">Jonathan Grimes</a>
