eight-game losing streak.\n\nDelaware State (3-8, 1-7 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference) trailed 36-24 before Elko led the Hornets on two fourth-quarter touchdown drives. Elko capped off the first drive with a 38-yard strike to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/476580/travis-tarpley\" target=\"_new\">Travis Tarpley</a> to draw Delaware State within five points of the lead, 36-31. Elko and Tarpley connected again two drives later from 28 yards out to take a 37-36 lead. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/380941/darius-jackson\" target=\"_new\">Darius Jackson</a> caught a pass from Elko on the two-point conversion to create the final margin.\n\nElko, who was benched before Delaware State's game last week with Hampton, bounced back nicely, throwing for 324 yards on 28-of-44 passing.\n\nHoward (5-6, 4-4) fought back, driving to Delaware State's 26-yard line on its final possession. But Parker Munoz's 43-yard field goal fell short as time expired."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"South Carolina State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2569/south-carolina-state","id":"2569","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2569","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"7-5","displayValue":"7-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"5-0","displayValue":"5-0"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2569.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"North Carolina Central","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2428/north-carolina-central","id":"2428","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2428","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"6-5","displayValue":"6-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"4-1","displayValue":"4-1"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2428.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Delaware State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2169/delaware-state","id":"2169","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2169","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"5-6","displayValue":"5-6"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"2-3","displayValue":"2-3"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2169.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Norfolk State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2450/norfolk-state","id":"2450","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2450","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"6-5","displayValue":"6-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"2-3","displayValue":"2-3"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2450.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Howard","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/47/howard","id":"47","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:47","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"3-8","displayValue":"3-8"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"1-4","displayValue":"1-4"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/47.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Morgan State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2415/morgan-state","id":"2415","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2415","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"2-9","displayValue":"2-9"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"1-4","displayValue":"1-4"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2415.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]}]},"header":"2021 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Standings"}]}}
