fourth quarter to upset Towson 35-30 Saturday night in Colonial Athletic Association action.\n\nThe upset handed Towson (6-2, 4-1) its first conference loss.\n\nTrailing 10-0 early, Delaware (5-4, 3-3) regrouped behind Pierce, who carried 34 times for 158 yards and scored on runs of 23, 13 and 5 yards. The last was the game-winner late in the third quarter. Towson's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/516385/terrance-west\" target=\"_new\">Terrance West</a> was spectacular, too: a career-high 155 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nWest scored three times before halftime, including a 46-yard run in the first quarter. Travis Hawkins returned a kickoff 86 yards for a touchdown in the second to put Towson up 22-16. West scored his final touchdown in the third quarter to put Towson up, 30-29. But Pierce's touchdown late in the third quarter and a defensive stand near midfield won it."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
