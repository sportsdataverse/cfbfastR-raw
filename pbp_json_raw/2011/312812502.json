State on Saturday.\n\nPortland State rallied from a 38-22 deficit in the final 7 minutes, but came up short on a two-point conversion with 2:52 remaining that could have sent the game into overtime.\n\nMcGhee had a hand in all five touchdowns for Montana State (5-1, 3-0 Big Sky), throwing for TDs of 5, 24, 69 and 6 yards, while also scoring on a 1-yard run.\n\nPortland State (3-2, 2-1) pulled within 38-30 on a 1-yard run from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=379178\" target=\"_new\">Cory McCaffrey</a> with 3:46 remaining.
