Chapple then led Harvard on two consecutive scoring drives, throwing touchdown passes of 27 and 26 yards to put the game out of reach.\n\nChapple, who also added 34 yards on the ground, recorded Harvard's first 400-yard passing game since 2003 while Sarkisian reaped the rewards, grabbing seven catches for 112 yards.\n\nThe Cornell offense moved the ball well as Jeff Matthews threw for 322
