yards of total offense. The last time the Tigers gained more than 500 yards was Oct. 28, 2006 against Delaware.\n\nThe Tigers led only 14-3 at halftime, but scored 21 points in the third quarter to put it away. The Tigers held the ball for more than 11 minutes in the quarter. Towson held possession for more than 39 minutes in the game as three of its touchdown drives took more than 10 plays.\n\nThe win was the 11th in a row at home in the series for the Tigers, who hold a
