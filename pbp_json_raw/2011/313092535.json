highlighting a strong defensive outing for Chattanooga in a 24-9 win over Samford on Saturday.\n\nDothard's touchdown gave the Mocs (5-5, 3-4 Southern Conference) a 17-6 lead early in the third quarter, and their defense did the rest.\n\nChattanooga allowed just 92 yards rushing, forced a fumble, an interception and tallied four sacks. Joshua Williams had two of those sacks, totaling 23 yards.  Ryan Consiglio, who leads the Mocs with 9.7 tackles per game, finished with 14 against the Bulldogs (5-4, 3-4).\n\nChattanooga's <a

left in the first quarter.\n\nThe Bulldogs' only source of offense came from Cameron Yaw, who made field goals of 36, 27 and 38 yards."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
