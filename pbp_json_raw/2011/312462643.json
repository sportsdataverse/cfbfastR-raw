31-9 win over Jacksonville Saturday in the season opener for both teams.\n\nThe Bulldogs were relentless, racking up 439 rushing yards on 54 attempts. Running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=499733\" target=\"_new\">Ben Dupree</a> led the way with 141 yards on 22 carries and two touchdowns.\n\nHis scores sparked Citadel's offense. With Jacksonville up 9-0 late in the second quarter, Dupree scored on a 58-yard run, then ripped off a 28-yarder to put the Bulldogs ahead 14-9.\n\nCitadel controlled the clock the rest of the game, deploying a fleet of running backs to pound Jacksonville's defense.\n\nBulldogs' running backs <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=499745\" target=\"_new\">Darien Robinson</a>, 82 yards on eight carries, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=499751\" target=\"_new\">Dalton Trevino</a>, 63 yards on seven carries, both added touchdowns to put the game
