Soven's 27-yard field goal on the final play gave Towson a 31-28 victory over Richmond on Saturday night and overcame a record-setting performance by Spiders quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236574\" target=\"_new\">Aaron Corp</a>.\n\nCorp completed 31 of 34 passes, a 91.2 percent completion percentage, for Richmond (3-3, 0-3 Colonial Athletic Association), surpassing the Football Championship Subdivision record for quarterbacks throwing at least 30 passes in a game. Drake's Mike Piatkowski set the previous mark of 90.9 percent (30 for 33) last week against Campbell.\n\nSoven's kick capped a 54-yard drive by the Tigers (4-1, 2-0), which included five carries by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=516385\" target=\"_new\">Terrance West</a>, who finished with 128 yards and four touchdowns on 21 carries.\n\nCorp passed for 353 yards and two fourth-quarter touchdowns. The second tied the game at 28 with 2:38 remaining.\n\nWhile not as prolific as Corp, Towson quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=519428\" target=\"_new\">Grant Enders</a> also was sharp, completing 15 of 19 for 185 yards."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
