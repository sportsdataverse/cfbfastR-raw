unbeaten Richmond with 28 second-quarter points -- including two interceptions returned for touchdowns -- and upset the Spiders 45-43 Saturday in the Colonial Athletic Association opener for both teams.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234281\" target=\"_new\">Kevin Decker</a>, the New Hampshire quarterback who accounted for five touchdowns in last week's 48-41 overtime win against Lehigh, ran for two touchdowns against Richmond (3-1) and threw for two more -- both to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=498522\" target=\"_new\">R.J. Harris</a>. The last of Harris' 12 catches was a 47-yard, fourth-quarter scoring reception that put the Wildcats ahead 45-36 and proved to be the game-winner. But this game turned in a frenetic second quarter.\n\nThat's when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236574\" target=\"_new\">Aaron Corp</a>, Richmond's senior quarterback whose 35 completions (16 to Tre Gay) in 50 attempts produced two touchdowns, was victimized twice. Randi Vines went 60 yards with an interception to score. Matt Evans' 31-yard pick put New Hampshire up 28-13."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
