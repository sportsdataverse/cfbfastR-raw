Delaware State on Saturday night.\n\nFleming, a freshman quarterback who made his first start, completed 14 of 29 passes and threw one interception for the Rattlers (3-2, 1-1 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference).  He connected with Brian Tyms on a 23-yard touchdown to give Florida A&M a 13-0 lead.\n\nThe Ratters' defense was solid against Delaware State (2-3, 0-2), holding them to 181 total yards. Despite the Hornets offensive struggles, they were able to score for the first time in more than 11 quarters when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=514938\" target=\"_new\">Milton Williams</a> caught a 9-yard pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=380943\" target=\"_new\">Nick Elko</a> in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut Florida A&M would not allow the Hornets to score the rest of the way.
