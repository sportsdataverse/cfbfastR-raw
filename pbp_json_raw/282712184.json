to beat Dayton 24-16 on Saturday.\n\nThe game was tied 10-10 at halftime and Duquesne (2-1) trailed 16-10 after Nick Glavin kicked field goals of 40 and 27 yards for Dayton (3-1) in the second half.\n\nDixon, who completed just 12 of 32 passes, rallied Duquesne. He gave the Dukes a 17-16 lead with an 11-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159159\">Alex Roberson</a> that capped a seven-play, 72-yard drive with 8:09 left.\n\nDayton drove 36 yards on 9 plays before Duquense blocked a punt and recovered at the Dayton 39. Seven plays later, Dixon scored on a 1-yard run and Duquesne led 24-16 with 1:18 left.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=388093\">Akeem Moore</a> sealed the win for Duquesne when he intercepted <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=163961\">Rob Florian</a>'s pass on the first play of Dayton's next possession. The Dukes then ran out the clock.\n\nDixon finished with 230 yards passing and also threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=176067\">Michael Rasky</a> to open the scoring in the first quarter.\n\nFlorian completed 27 or 54 passes for 277 yards but also threw another interception, to Duquesne's Bill
