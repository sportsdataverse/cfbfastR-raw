(AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159794\">Antonio Miller</a> threw three touchdown passes, including a 25-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233725\">Thomas Hinton</a> in overtime, to lead Chattanooga to a 45-38 win over Georgia Southern Saturday night.\n\nIt was a single game career high for Miller, who was returning to the starting lineup after suffering a knee injury in the Mocs season opening loss to Carson-Newman.\n\nMiller finished with 12 completions in 26 attempts for 151 yards to lead Chattanooga (1-2, 1-0) to its first win of the season.\n\nIt was the Southern Conference opener for both teams. Georgia Southern (2-1, 0-1) got another outstanding night from quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=153054\">Jayson Foster</a> who rushed for 210 yards and completed 16 of 19 passes for 120 yards.\n\nFoster became the first Georgia Southern player to ever run for 200 or more yards in three consecutive games. Chattanooga led 17-14 at the half, but had to rally from a 28-17 deficit to get their first ever win in the Eagles Paulsen Stadium in 11 games.\n\nGeorgia Southern leads the series 18-3 but the Mocs have won the last two years. Foster scored three touchdowns on runs of 36, 60 and 14 yards to push his season total to 12. He scored touchdowns on the Eagles first two possessions of the second half, and it looked like Georgia Southern was taking control of the game.\n\nBut Chattanooga answered Foster's 14 yard run, which put the Eagles up 28-17 with 10:11 to go in the third period, with an 80-yard drive that ended with Miller passing five yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=178672\">Blue Cooper</a>.\n\nChattanooga regained the lead when defensive back Jeff Phillips returned Foster's fumble 63 yards to put his team back in front.\n\nSouthern tied it on a field goal and after the Mocs got a 19-yard run from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187302\">Erroll Wynn</a> the Eagles sent it into overtime on a three-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=158480\">Mike Hamilton</a> with 1:17 to play.\n\nThe Mocs got the first possession and on second down Miller found Hinton in the end zone where he had eluded the Eagles' Carson Hill. Wynn led the Mocs with 125 yards rushing on 27 attempts, scoring two touchdowns."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
