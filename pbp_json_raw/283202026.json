href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190009\">Armanti Edwards</a> threw three touchdown passes and Appalachian State survived a late scare to beat Elon 24-16 on Saturday.\n\nEdwards was 12 of 14 for 147 yards and added 104 yards rushing for the Mountaineers (9-2, 7-0 Southern Conference), who trailed by two points early in the third quarter.\n\nHowever, Edwards' third scoring pass -- a 22-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234141\">Brian Quick</a> with 9:49 left in the third quarter -- gave Appalachian State the lead.\n\nEdwards left the game midway through the fourth quarter after a late hit, and backup <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=381870\">DeAndre Presley</a> drove the Mountaineers to a 24-yard field goal with 9:04 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nAppalachian State stopped the Phoenix (8-3, 6-2) twice -- including a fourth-and-inches -- in the final six minutes to win its eighth straight game.\n\nElon's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233773\">Scott Riddle</a> threw for 196 yards and two touchdowns, including a 13-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=178004\">Terrell Hudgins</a> with 11:10 remaining in the third quarter that put the Phoenix ahead 16-14.\n\nRiddle was 20 of 39 with one interception.\n\nAppalachian State bolted to a 14-0 lead in the first half behind Edwards, who threw for 95 yards and a pair of touchdowns, and ran for 99 more yards.\n\nHe found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234138\">Ben Jorden</a> in the back of the end zone on a 13-yard touchdown pass with 4:02 left in the first quarter to give the Mountaineers the lead, then hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190007\">Matt Cline</a> on a 33-yard scoring pass with 12:29 left in the second quarter.\n\nElon pulled within 14-7 on Riddle's 55-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171677\">Bo Williamson</a> with 9:11 remaining, then thwarted a chance for Appalachian State to widen its lead when it stopped a fourth-and-1 at the Phoenix 4 with less than four minutes left.\n\nElon had a shot to tie the game when it recovered a muffed punt at the Mountaineers' 19 with 47.1 seconds left.\n\nThe Phoenix drove to the Appalachian 4, but had to settle for Andrew Wilcox's 21-yard field goal and a 14-10 margin at the break.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185503\">Brandon Newsome</a> added 118 yards rushing for Elon, which has lost two of its past three games."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
