The Bulldogs beat Georgia Tech for the first time in 11 tries and posted the first victory against an ACC team in 23 attempts.\n\nCharleston Southern (0-4) drove to the Bulldogs' 1 in the closing minutes but could not punch it in after having a first down at the 1.\n\nAfter Bulmer's touchdown run for the first score in the second quarter, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4246109/alex-usry\" target=\"_new\">Alex Usry</a> booted a 35-yard field goal and added a 48-yarder early in the third to close to 7-6. The Bulldogs answered when Murdaugh nailed Webb on a 54-yard scoring toss with 6:03 left in the third. Bulmer bulled in from the 1 to go up 20-6 late in that quarter.\n\nThe Bulldogs (2-2) added a safety for the final score when the Buccaneers fumbled in their own end zone after <a
