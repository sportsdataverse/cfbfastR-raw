quarter and Drake rolled to a 52-12 victory over Division II member Missouri S&T in the Bulldogs' home opener on Saturday.\n\nKraemer connected with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4029965/drew-lauer\" target=\"_new\">Drew Lauer</a>, who broke several tackles for a 58-yard score on the Bulldogs' first possession, and Kraemer used just one play to hook up with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4051486/mitch-mcfarlane\" target=\"_new\">Mitch McFarlane</a> for a 65-yard score on their second drive for a 14-0 lead. Kraemer found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4029955/devin-cates\" target=\"_new\">Devin Cates</a> for two short second-quarter scores, sandwiched around Aaron Moya's 3-yard TD run for the Miners, for a 28-6 halftime lead. Kraemer hit 11 of 12 passes for 269 yards by halftime, and his only incompletion was an interception.\n\nKraemer had his fifth TD pass two plays into the third quarter on a 50-yard strike to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4029959/steven-doran\" target=\"_new\">Steven Doran</a> and then found McFarlane for a second time from 12 yards out to make it 42-6 -- ending Kraemer's day. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4029958/danny-donley\" target=\"_new\">Danny Donley</a>'s 38-yard field goal in the fourth quarter and a 26-yard interception return by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4034601/will-warner\" target=\"_new\">Will Warner</a> capped the scoring for Drake (1-1).\n\nRod Chapman returned a punt 82 yards for a score on the final play of the game for Missouri A&T."},"videos":[],"scoringPlays":[{"id":"401030582101874201","type":{"id":"67","text":"Passing Touchdown","abbreviation":"TD"},"text":"Drew
