His 35-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=477569\" target=\"_new\">Daniel McFadden</a> put Furman ahead 24-7 with 8:39 to play, and his 3-yard touchdown run with 3:19 left gave Furman its final margin.\n\nThe Citadel (2-2, 0-1) had closed to within 17-7 and recovered an onside kick with 11:18 left, but Worley found McFadden behind the defense for the touchdown three plays after Max Lerner's interception.\n\nWorley completed 12 of 20 passes for 171 yards and rushed for 36 yards on 12 carries.\n\nThe Bulldogs had 294 yards rushing and 359 yards total offense to Furman's 296.
