href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/386057/brock-jackolski\" target=\"_new\">Brock Jackolski</a>, Stony Brook's option offense shredded Coastal Carolina for a 42-0 victory Saturday in Big South Conference play.\n\nOn a wintry day on Long Island, Stony Brook (5-3, 3-0) had a field day against the Chanticleers. Maysonet carried 26 times for 191 yards and three touchdowns -- two in the first quarter on runs of 9 and 1 yard for a 14-0 halftime lead. With Jackolski running for 193 yards and a touchdown, Stony Brook accumulated 446 yards total offense -- all on the ground. The Seawolves were 0-for-6 passing but that hardly mattered.\n\nCoastal Carolina (4-4, 1-2) managed 73 total yards while losing its third straight. Stony Brook's lone non-rushing touchdown came in the third quarter on a blocked punt, Jonathan Coats returning it for a 2-yard score. JeVahn Cruz completed the scoring with a 43-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
