(AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=149020\">Renaldo Gray</a> threw for 232 yards and accounted for two touchdowns as Furman beat Georgia Southern 24-22 on Saturday when the Eagles missed a 33-yard field goal on the game's final play.\n\nThe Eagles (7-3, 4-3 Southern Conference) took a 14-3 lead with 14:08 left in the second quarter when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=153054\">Jayson Foster</a> threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=168785\">Raja Andrews</a>. The two connected again about five minutes later on a 48-yard TD.\n\nBut Georgia Southern struggled to get Foster going in the run game. The senior quarterback, who averaged 174.1 yards rushing coming into the game, was held to a season-low 82 yards on 26 carries.\n\nWhile the Paladins (5-5, 3-3) defense played strong, they scored 21 unanswered points over two quarters. It started off when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=158755\">Brantley Kendall</a> caught a 5-yard pass from Gray in the second quarter.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=158753\">Jerome Felton</a>, who finished with 52 yards rushing, scored on a 7-yard run in the third. Then Gray, who had 49 yards on 13 carries, scored on a 9-yard run to give Furman a 24-15 lead.\n\nGeorgia Southern scored with 5:22 remaining in the fourth when fullback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=168284\">Dusty Reddick</a> caught a 20-yard touchdown pass from Foster, who also threw for 190 yards.\n\nOn their next possession, the Eagles were able to drive down to the Furman 16-yard line with four seconds left in the game to setup for a game-winning field goal. But Jesse Hartley missed the 33-yard attempt on the final play of the game.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=166665\">Lamar Lewis</a> ran for 86 yards on 17 carries, while Andrews had 71 yards recieving for Georgia Southern.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173391\">Larry Hedden</a> had eight catches for 78 yards for the
