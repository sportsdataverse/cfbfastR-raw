But the Hampton defense held, and its offense then went 96 yards in 15 plays, a drive that culminated with Morgan's 1-yard run.\n\nPrinceton's Matt Murphy blocked the extra point attempt to keep the score at 27-27, but Hampton took the lead for good when Beverly ran in from a yard out with 4:31 left. The Pirates then got the ball right back on a Sam Pope interception, and they took a 41-27 lead when Beverly scored on a 1-yard run.\n\nPope then picked off another pass and ran it back 65 yards for the final score.\n\nHampton had taken an early 7-0 lead on Morgan's 2-yard run, but Princeton tied it on a juggling 19-yard touchdown catch by <a
