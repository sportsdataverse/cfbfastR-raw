Connor Kempe was 8-for-22 with 75 yards passing with two touchdowns and an interception.\n\nThe Big Green jumped out to a 14-0 lead in the first quarter thanks to Kempe's 24-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191884\">Niles Murphy</a> and a 7-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=385918\">Michael Reilly</a>. They pushed the lead to 21-0 to start the fourth when Charles Bay picked up a fumble and ran it back 39 yards for a score.\n\nAfter <a
