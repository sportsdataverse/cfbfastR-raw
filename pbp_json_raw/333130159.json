href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/505444/dominick-pierre\" target=\"_new\">Dominick Pierre</a> scored the first two touchdowns of the game on a pair of 3-yard runs, and Dartmouth went on to a 34-6 victory over Cornell on Saturday night.\n\nPierre, Dartmouth's second all-time leading rusher, has run for touchdowns in all eight Big Green (4-4, 3-2) games and has 11 this season. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/529817/kyle-bramble\" target=\"_new\">Kyle Bramble</a> was the workhorse for Dartmouth, rushing for a career-high 110 yards on 24 carries. Dartmouth had 291 yards rushing.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/529805/dalyn-williams\" target=\"_new\">Dalyn Williams</a> threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/514308/bo-patterson\" target=\"_new\">Bo Patterson</a> to end the half for a 21-0 lead. The Big Green outgained Cornell 366-83 in the first half.\n\nThe Big Red (1-7, 0-5) have lost seven consecutive games since a season-opening victory over Bucknell. They could get little going against Dartmouth's defense, which leads the Ivy League in fewest points allowed. Cornell had just 216 yards of total offense, with just 46 yards coming on the ground.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/548302/kevin-price\" target=\"_new\">Kevin Price</a>, a 31-year-old Army Ranger veteran, carried the ball twice for 1 yard in the final minutes for Dartmouth. With Veterans Day coming up, Price, playing in his second game this season, was made an honorary captain. The father of two did six tours in Iraq and Afghanistan."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
