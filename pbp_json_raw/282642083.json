Cornell held off Bucknell 21-20 on Saturday night.\n\nFord and Baker connected on touchdown passes of 8 and 5 yards and the Big Red got a key play on special teams to pull out the win.\n\nCornell (1-0) took a 21-14 lead on Ford's second touchdown pass in the third quarter. The Bison responded with a touchdown pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188852\">Marcello Trigg</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233197\">Shaun Pasternak</a> with 10:56 to go, but Graham Rihn blocked the extra point to keep the score 21-20.\n\nThe Big Red had a chance to put the game away later in the quarter when they drove down to the Bucknell 7-yard line, but Sam Nana-Sinkam picked off Ford near the goal line and returned the ball to the Bucknell 27. However, the Bison (2-1) were unable to mount a drive and punted, allowing Cornell to run out the clock.\n\nFord was 21-for-26 for 207 yards and two interceptions and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185646\">Randy Barbour</a> rushed for 114 yards and scored on a 13-yard run for Cornell.\n\nTrigg was 19-for-27 for 219 yards with two touchdowns to Pasternak, who had 11 catches for 117 yards.\n\nCornell held the Bison to just 46 yards on the ground and sacked Trigg three times."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
