for 51 yards to lead Villanova past Northeastern, 20-14, on Saturday.\n\nDown by six, Northeastern drove to the Villanova 13-yard line with less than six minutes to play before Villanova's Marquis Kirkland intercepted a deflected pass. After that, Villanova never gave up the ball.\n\nWhitney completed 11-of-16 passes, and threw two interceptions. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191307\">Aaron Ball</a> carried 17 times for 91 yards, including a 6-yard touchdown run for Villanova (6-2, 4-1 Colonial Athletic Association).\n\nFor Northeastern (2-7, 1-4 CAA), <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159499\">Alex Broomfield</a> had 48 rushing yards on 18 carries and threw a touchdown. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159495\">Anthony Orio</a> was 16-of-25 for 158 yards and a touchdown along with two interceptions.\n\nNortheastern scored first with some trickery on its opening drive. On fourth-and-8 from his own 30, punter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171241\">Ron Conway</a> faked the kick and completed a 14-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234310\">Tony Torres</a>. Broomfield finished the drive when he hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159518\">Brian Mandeville</a> for a 12-yard touchdown.\n\nVillanova answered minutes later when Whitney hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234103\">Matthew Szczur</a> over the middle for a 20-yard touchdown.\n\nBall's scoring run four seconds into the second quarter capped a 73-yard drive that was set up by Osayi Osunde's interception.\n\nJoe Marcoux added second quarter field goals of 28 and 42 yards to put Villanova up 20-7 at the half.\n\nA 20-yard third quarter touchdown reception by Northeastern's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171235\">Tony Lott</a> was the only score of the second half."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
