quarter. By halftime, it was 41-0.\n\nTennessee State also ended a nine-game conference losing streak.\n\nSoutheast Missouri, the defending Ohio Valley champion, was scoreless until placekicker Drew Geldbach's 30-yard field goal with 6:51 left helped the Redhawks (2-4, 1-2) avoid a shutout. It was Southeast Missouri's most lopsided defeat since a 52-0 loss at Middle Tennessee in 1991.\n\nTennessee State had a season-high 536 yards total offense to Southeast Missouri's 158.  In the first half it was 406 to 13.\n\nFor the Tigers, Mike German passed for 264 yards and two touchdowns while <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486277\"
