yards and scored two touchdowns apiece, leading Illinois State to a 57-6 victory over Indiana State on Saturday.\n\nThe Redbirds (2-2, 1-0 Missouri Valley) gave up an early field goal by Corey Varnadore but took the lead on the first touchdown run by Blow and controlled the rest of the game. It was the 19th straight loss since 2006 for the Sycamores (0-5, 0-1).\n\nIllinois State scored on five of its first six possessions, including a 16-yard pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=158283\">Kevin Brockway</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185322\">Garin Harcar</a> for a 14-3 lead after the first quarter.\n\nIndiana State managed only one more field goal, a 44-yarder by Braulio Martinez with 2 seconds left in the first half, and was shut out in the final two periods.\n\nThe Redbirds, meanwhile, built their lead to 27-6 at halftime and added a safety and two more touchdowns in the third quarter on short runs by Blow and Mendenhall. Illinois State completed the rout in the final period with a 40-yard touchdown run by Mendenhall and a 17-yard TD pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=235424\">Drew Kiel</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=158301\">Kevett Mickle</a>.\n\nBlow finished with 119 yards on 23 carries and Mendenhall totaled 103 yards on 10 runs as Illinois State outgained Indiana State 410-99 on the ground.
