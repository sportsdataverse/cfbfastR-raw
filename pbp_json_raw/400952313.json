another as Southeastern Louisiana cruised to its fifth straight win, rolling over Abilene Christian 56-21 on Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe Lions broke a school record with their fifth straight game of scoring over 40 points. Southeastern Louisiana (5-3, 5-1 Southland Conference) opened the season with three losses before topping Lamar 49-21 to start the win streak.\n\nNunez, who sat out most of the fourth quarter, had scoring runs of 39 and three yards to give the Lions a 21-13 halftime advantage.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3133340/eugene-bethea\" target=\"_new\">Eugene Bethea</a>, who finished with 108 yards rushing, broke for a 65-yard scoring scamper late in the third quarter for a 35-13 lead and Nunez ran in from the 11 early in the fourth for his final score.\n\nThe Lions rolled up 623 total yards while limiting ACU (2-6, 2-4), to 293 yards.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3928803/tracy-james\" target=\"_new\">Tracy
