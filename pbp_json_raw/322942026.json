href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/380548/eric-breitenstein\" target=\"_new\">Eric Breitenstein</a> ran for 123 of Wofford's 393 rushing yards as the Terriers won at Appalachian State 38-28 Saturday in a Southern Conference contest.\n\nBreitenstein carried the ball 24 times and scored a pair of touchdowns, including what proved the game-winning score on the first play of the fourth quarter -- a 1-yard scamper that capped an 11-play, 75-yard drive and put Wofford (6-1, 4-1) ahead 31-28.\n\nThe Terriers outrushed the Mountaineers (5-3, 3-2) by 287 yards and averaged 6.3 yards per carry. Brian Cass and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/514370/cam-flowers\" target=\"_new\">Cam Flowers</a> also ran for touchdowns.\n\nWofford took a 24-21 lead on Flowers' 5-yard TD run in the third quarter, but lost the advantage when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/486059/tony-washington\" target=\"_new\">Tony Washington</a> returned the ensuing kickoff 99 yards for a go-ahead touchdown.\n\nAppalachian State's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/486056/jamal-jackson\" target=\"_new\">Jamal Jackson</a> completed 29-of-46 passes for 257 yards and an interception.
