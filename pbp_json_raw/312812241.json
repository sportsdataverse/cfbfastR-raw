href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=237885\" target=\"_new\">Mike Brown</a> passed for two touchdowns and rushed for another as Liberty routed Gardner-Webb 35-3 on Saturday in the Big South opener for both teams.\n\nLiberty led 14-0 before Gardner-Webb's offense touched the ball. Brown gave the Flames (3-3) a 7-0 lead on a 1-yard run, then threw a 33-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=242039\" target=\"_new\">Chris Summers</a> after the Bulldogs fumbled the ensuing kickoff. Brown finished with a career-high 363 yards passing for the Flames. His second touchdown pass went 17 yards to Tommy Shaver in the third quarter for a 28-3 lead.\n\nIt was the fifth straight win in the series for the Flames, who have won those games by an average of 30 points. The win gives the Flames a 9-8-1 edge in the series.\n\nSummers caught nine passes for 133 yards while Shaver had four catches for 110 yards.\n\nGardner-Webb (1-4, 0-1) converted only 2 of 13 third downs."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"Notre
