(AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=153054\">Jayson Foster</a> ran for 231 yards, threw for 124 yards and accounted for four touchdowns to lead Georgia Southern to a 45-21 victory over West Georgia on Saturday night.\n\nIt was a successful coaching debut for Chris Hatcher, who took over as Eagles coach after winning a national championship at Valdosta State in NCAA Division II. He was brought on to restore Georgia Southern's prestige as a Football Championship Subdivision powerhouse again after finishing 3-8 last season, the last when the division was recognized as 1-AA.\n\nBut Hatcher's first win didn't come easy. The Wolves took a 21-10 lead in the second quarter when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=194323\">Keats Baldwin</a> threw a 7-yard touchdown to Daniel Johnson, then Baldwin scored on an 11-yard run.\n\nThe Eagles (1-0) took control after halftime, scoring twice on Foster's 56-yard run and a 41-yard touchdown by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=238431\">Zeke Rozier</a>, who finished with 53 yards on seven carries.\n\nHatcher, known for his passing philosophy, mostly used the running game as Georgia Southern gained its edge. Foster, who completed 6-of-9 passes, connected with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160212\">Michael McIntosh</a> on an 81-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter.\n\nAfter Rozier scored his second rushing touchdown, Foster added a 74-yard touchdown for the Eagles. Foster also had a 54 yard scoring run in the opening quarter.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=166665\">Lamar Lewis</a> also helped a strong Georgia Southern rushing attack, gaining 150 yards on 14 attempts.\n\nBaldwin completed 21-of-35 passes for 224 yards for West Georgia (1-1). James Kennebrew, who led the Wolves with 49 yards, had a 4-yard touchdown run in the first quarter."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"West Florida","id":"110242","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:110242","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"9-2","displayValue":"9-2"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"6-1","displayValue":"6-1"}]},{"team":"Valdosta State","id":"2673","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2673","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"12-2","displayValue":"12-2"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"6-1","displayValue":"6-1"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2673.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2019-08-22T19:09Z"}]},{"team":"West Georgia","id":"2698","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2698","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"9-3","displayValue":"9-3"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"6-2","displayValue":"6-2"}]},{"team":"West Alabama","id":"2695","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2695","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"6-4","displayValue":"6-4"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"4-4","displayValue":"4-4"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2695.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2019-08-22T18:35Z"}]},{"team":"Delta State","id":"2170","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2170","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"5-6","displayValue":"5-6"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"3-5","displayValue":"3-5"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2170.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2019-08-23T16:14Z"}]},{"team":"Mississippi College","id":"2401","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2401","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"4-6","displayValue":"4-6"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"3-5","displayValue":"3-5"}]},{"team":"North Greenville","id":"2822","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2822","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"5-6","displayValue":"5-6"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"2-5","displayValue":"2-5"}]},{"team":"Shorter","id":"2560","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2560","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"3-8","displayValue":"3-8"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"0-7","displayValue":"0-7"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2560.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2019-09-12T21:18Z"}]}]},"header":"2021 Gulf South Standings"},{"divisions":[{"header":"Sun Belt -
