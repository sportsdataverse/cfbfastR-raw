(AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=163238\">Byron Selby</a> passed for two touchdowns and ran for another as Morgan St. defeated Bethune-Cookman 33-9 on Saturday.\n\nBethune-Cookman (2-3) suffered five turnovers, including four interceptions, and managed a season-low 148 yards of offense.\n\nSelby's three-yard run with 4:41 to go in the third quarter broke a 9-9 halftime tie. His second TD toss, this one an 18-yarder to Robert Surratt, came with 15 seconds left in the third period.\n\nJames Meade added a 21-yard field goal for Morgan St. (2-3) with 9:55 left in the final period, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186205\">Devan James</a> finished the scoring with a 65-yard TD run with 4:17 remaining.\n\nBethune-Cookman had scored first when James Monds returned 24 yards for a touchdown off a Morgan St. punt that had been blocked by teammate Nick Mayant. Lucas Esquivel's extra-point kick made it 7-0 with 3:09 left in the first quarter.\n\nMorgan St. set up its first score when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=176011\">Rupert Gill</a> blocked a Bethune-Cookman punt to put the Bears on the Wildcat six-yard line. Two plays later Selby passed six yards to Roderick Wolfe in the end zone.\n\nBut on the ensuing extra-point try by James Meade for Morgan St., Bethune-Cookman's Brandon Odom blocked the kick. Ben Ballard picked it up for the Wildcats and ran the length of the field to give the Wildcats two points and a 9-6 lead with 5:46 left in the first half.\n\nMeade's 35-yard field goal made it a 9-9 game at the half."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"South Carolina State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2569/south-carolina-state","id":"2569","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2569","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"7-5","displayValue":"7-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"5-0","displayValue":"5-0"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2569.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"North Carolina Central","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2428/north-carolina-central","id":"2428","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2428","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"6-5","displayValue":"6-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"4-1","displayValue":"4-1"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2428.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Delaware State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2169/delaware-state","id":"2169","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2169","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"5-6","displayValue":"5-6"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"2-3","displayValue":"2-3"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2169.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Norfolk State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2450/norfolk-state","id":"2450","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2450","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"6-5","displayValue":"6-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"2-3","displayValue":"2-3"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2450.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Howard","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/47/howard","id":"47","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:47","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"3-8","displayValue":"3-8"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"1-4","displayValue":"1-4"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/47.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Morgan State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2415/morgan-state","id":"2415","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2415","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"2-9","displayValue":"2-9"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"1-4","displayValue":"1-4"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2415.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]}]},"header":"2021 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference Standings"},{"divisions":[{"header":"Southwestern Athletic -
