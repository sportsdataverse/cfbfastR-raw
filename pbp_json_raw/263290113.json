(AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=157911\">Liam Coen</a> passed for three touchdowns -- including his team's last three scores -- to lifted Massachusetts to a 35-14 victory over Lafayette in the NCAA Division I-AA playoffs Saturday.\n\nThe win for Atlantic 10 Conference champion UMass (11-1) was its 10th straight. Lafayette (6-6) was the automatic qualifier from the Patriot League.\n\nUMass will play host to New Hampshire, which beat Hampton 41-38, next Saturday in a quarterfinal game.\n\nCoen completed touchdown passes of 33 yards to Mike Omar in the second quarter, 7 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=157918\">Ian Jorgensen</a> in the third and 18 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=151270\">Brandon London</a> in the fourth.\n\nUMass scored on its first three possessions to take a 21-0 lead, but mistakes helped Lafayette get two touchdowns to narrow the gap to 21-14 at halftime.\n\nAn interception by Torian Johnson gave Lafayette the ball on the UMass 34. Three plays later, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173044\">Shaun Adair</a> caught a 26-yard touchdown pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=150984\">Brad Maurer</a>.\n\nA turnover on the ensuing kickoff enabled Maurer to pass 31 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159048\">Duaeno Dorsey</a> for the Leopards' final score.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=151208\">Steve Baylark</a>, who rushed for l52 yards, scored touchdown runs of 8 and 26 yards to give UMass a 14-0 start in the first quarter.\n\nCoen was 9-for-15 for 151 yards passing, giving him 2,330 yards for the season.\n\nLafayette's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=150974\">Jonathan Hurt</a>, the leading rusher in the Patriot League, was held to 41 yards on the ground."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"Holy
