Citadel 19-14 on Saturday.\n\nAfter The Citadel (4-6, 2-6 Southern Conference) jumped out to an early 14-0 lead following two <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/499733/ben-dupree\" target=\"_new\">Ben Dupree</a> touchdowns, Samford relied on Cameron Yaw and <a

Yaw kicked field goals from 22 and 44 yards while Taliaferro threw an 18-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/486827/chris-cephus\" target=\"_new\">Chris Cephus</a> to draw within one point of the lead, 14-13.\n\nTaliaferro then capped off a 15-play, 80-yard drive with a 2-yard touchdown run to give Samford (5-5, 4-4) a 19-14 lead. The drive used 4:06 of game clock and left The Citadel with only 6 seconds to play.\n\nTaliaferro completed a career-high 34 passes on 45 attempts for 240 yards and a touchdown in the win. His favorite target was <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/499930/kelsey-pope\" target=\"_new\">Kelsey Pope</a>, who had 113 yards receiving and set a Samford record with 17
