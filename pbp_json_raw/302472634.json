touchdown to spark Tennessee State's 27-14 win over Alabama A&M on Saturday night and give coach Rod Reed his first win.\n\nReed, who was an All-America linebacker for the Tigers from 1984-88, saw his team take a 27-0 halftime lead.\n\nAlthough Alabama A&M outgained Tennessee State 276-234 in total offense, the Tigers scored three second-quarter touchdowns, two on drives of 36 seconds or less.\n\nStarting at the Bulldogs 35, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=477202\" target=\"_new\">Jeremy Perry</a> threw a 15-yard touchdown pass two plays later to <a

Brown</a> capped a 92-yard, 17-play drive with a 4-yard scoring run. On the Tigers' next possession, Perry hit Hills for a 17-yard score on a three-play drive.\n\nAlabama A&M scored twice in the fourth quarter. <a
