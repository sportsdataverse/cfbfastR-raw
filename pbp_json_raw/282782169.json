the fourth quarter to lift Hampton to a 17-14 victory over Delaware State on Saturday.\n\nOn third-and-8 with 3 minutes, 19 seconds remaining in the game, Brown caught the pass and fought off four

Winton also rushed for a score on a 51-yarder in the third quarter that gave the Hornets their first lead, 7-6, with 11:57 remaining.\n\nTuravani made his first field goal in the first quarter for a 3-0 lead. His second, with 14:12 left in the half, gave the Pirates a 6-0 lead.\n\nHampton kicker Carlo Turvani made field goals of 42, 19 and 28 yards."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
