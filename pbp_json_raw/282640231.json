Furman's only score of the second half, but it was enough as the Paladins held off Delaware for a 23-21 victory on Saturday.\n\nCesari's kick gave Furman (3-1) a 23-14 lead with 13:59 remaining in the game.\n\nDelaware (1-2) cut the advantage to 23-21 on Rob Schoenhoft's 14-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161956\">Aaron Love</a> with 2:44 remaining but the Paladins were able to run out the clock.\n\nFurman took a 7-0 lead on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=380123\">Tersoo Uhaa</a>'s first of two 1-yard touchdown runs with 10:56 remaining in the first quarter.\n\nDelaware tied the game on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161693\">Johnathon Smith</a>'s 2-yard run with 5:55 remaining in the first, but the Paladins took a 20-7 lead into halftime on Uhaa's second touchdown and Thomas Twitty's 20-yard interception return.\n\nSmith's second 2-yard run cut the lead to 20-14 with 4:39 left in the third quarter.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186975\">Mike Brown</a> caught five passes for 91 yards and rushed for 63 yards for Furman. <a
