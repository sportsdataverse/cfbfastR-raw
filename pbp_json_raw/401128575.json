35-31 in a nonconference contest Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe Dukes (2-1) won their fourth straight over the Flyers and split back-to-back games in Ohio, falling to Youngstown State 34-14 last week. They continue their three-game road trip next week at New Hampshire.\n\nThe game was the home opener for Dayton (2-1).\n\nThe teams were tied, 21-21 at intermission and Dayton took the lead on a 97-yard kick-off return by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4384696/jake-chisholm\" target=\"_new\">Jake Chisholm</a> to open the second half. Less than three minutes later <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3919110/daniel-parr\" target=\"_new\">Daniel Parr</a> got Duquesne even once more with a 3-yard run for a touchdown.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4574450/sam-webster\" target=\"_new\">Sam Webster</a> put the Flyers back in front with a 32-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter. The Dukes regained the lead on Allen's TD plunge and Dayton's 11-play answering drive stalled at the Duquesne 31 with 1:49 left and the Flyers turned the ball over on downs.\n\nParr completed 18 of 22 passes for 187 yards and two touchdowns and ran for a third. Allen finished with 30 carries for 168 yards and two 1-yard touchdowns.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4031088/jack-cook\" target=\"_new\">Jack Cook</a> was 19 of 27 for
