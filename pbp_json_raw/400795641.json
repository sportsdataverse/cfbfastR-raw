href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/513877/john-robertson\" target=\"_new\">John Robertson</a>'s 4-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter proved to be the game-winner as Villanova stymied Fordham, 14-7 on Saturday.\n\nVillanova bounced back from a season-opening loss to Connecticut to win the 30th meeting of the long-time rivals.\n\nRobertson threw a 6-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/536737/kevin-gulyas\" target=\"_new\">Kevin Gulyas</a> to cap an 11-play, 69-yard drive early in the first quarter. Robertson then drove the Wildcats 56 yards in seven plays to take a 14-0 lead with 12:28 left in the first half.\n\nFordham answered when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/516349/kevin-anderson\" target=\"_new\">Kevin Anderson</a> threw a 20-yard scoring strike to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3909347/corey-caddle\" target=\"_new\">Corey Caddle</a> to cut the lead with 3:52 left in the first half.\n\nVillanova limited Fordham to 111 yards passing on 10 of 23 attempts, and held the Rams to just 71 yards on the ground on 37 carries.\n\nRobertson was 12 of 18 for 161 yards passing and carried 21 times for 49 yards. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/536753/javon-white\" target=\"_new\">Javon White</a> finished with 143 yards on 23 carries.\n\n---\n\nAP College Football website:
