href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=485606\" target=\"_new\">Casey Brockman</a> threw for 497 yards and three touchdowns and ran for another score as Murray State routed Austin Peay 61-35 on Saturday.\n\nBrockman completed 38 of 57 passes, with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233110\" target=\"_new\">Marcus Harris</a> catching 11 for 138 yards and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=479426\" target=\"_new\">Rashad Daniels</a> nine for 122 yards.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=499221\" target=\"_new\">Duane Brady</a> added 22 carries for 114 yards and two TDs for the Racers (5-5, 4-3 Ohio Valley Conference), who won two road games in a season for the first time since 2004.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=475751\" target=\"_new\">Terrence Holt</a> had 140 yards on 14 carries, including a season-high three touchdowns for the Governors (2-8, 1-6) while <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234423\" target=\"_new\">Ryan White</a> had one touchdown on 21 carries for 119 yards.\n\nHolt's first TD run, a 44-yard, third-down run, cut Murray State's lead to 21-14 at the beginning of the second quarter. The Racers answered with a 18-yard touchdown run by Brockman, and then back-to-back field goals to make it 34-14 at halftime.\n\nAustin Peay quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234415\" target=\"_new\">Trent Caffee</a>, who was making his first start of the season, remains in St. Thomas Hospital in Nashville after suffering an apparent neck injury during the second quarter.\n\nThe senior from Aledo, Texas, was attempting to scramble for a first down when his helmet was torn off in an attempted tackle. A helmet-less Caffee then had his head slammed into the shoulder pads of a defender before it struck the artificial turf.\n\nThe medical team worked on Caffee for approximately 25 minutes. He gave the thumbs-up sign to his teammates when leaving the field on a stretcher.\n\nAustin Peay hopes to have more information about his condition on Sunday."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"UT
