Richmond on Saturday.\n\nPierce rushed for a career-high 215 yards and scored on runs of 1 and 4 yards in the first half as the Blue Hens (6-4, 4-3 Colonial Athletic Association) raced to a 21-3 halftime lead.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/484527/tim-donnelly\" target=\"_new\">Tim Donnelly</a> passed for 129 yards and ran for a touchdown for Delaware, which won its second game in a row.\n\nDelaware's defense kept Richmond in check, intercepting three passes and recovering a fumble. Richmond, which penetrated the Delaware 20-yard-line only twice, was kept out of the end zone until <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/236574/aaron-corp\" target=\"_new\">Aaron
