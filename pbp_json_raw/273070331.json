(AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159972\">A.J. Jimerson</a> rushed for 100 yards and the Eastern Washington defense forced three key turnovers in a 17-7 victory over Northern Colorado on Saturday.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171156\">Matt Nichols</a> threw for one touchdown and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173583\">Dale Morris</a> rushed for another for the Eagles (6-3 overall, 4-2 Big Sky).\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234908\">David Woods</a>' 102 yards rushing led the Bears (1-9, 1-5), who were seeking their first back-to-back wins in almost four years.\n\nWith EWU trailing 7-3 midway through the third quarter, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190455\">Shane Eller</a> took Nichols' short pass and ran 29 yards for the go-ahead score.\n\nUNC took the ensuing kickoff to Eastern's 25, but <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187869\">Dominic Breazeale</a>'s pass was intercepted by Ryan Kelley at the 2-yard line.\n\nEastern's next possession resulted in a punt, but the Eagles' Nicholas Ramos recovered a fumble on the return at the UNC 31.\n\nNichols then hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171140\">Aaron Boyce</a> for 29 yards, setting up Morris' short plunge that put the Eagles up 17-7.\n\nNichols finished with 172 yards on 14-of-23 passing. Boyce had five catches for 87 yards.\n\nBreazeale completed 18-of-26 for 146 yards for the Bears, who opened a 7-0 lead on Woods' 7-yard TD run.\n\nUNC had a chance to increase the lead early in the second quarter, but fumbled a shovel pass at Eastern's 1-yard line that was recovered by the Eagles' Makai Borden.\n\nNorthern Colorado had lost 16 straight games before knocking off Montana State last week."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"Sacramento
