href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162458\">Devin Campbell</a> threw three touchdown passes and Gardner-Webb held off a late offensive charge to beat VMI 34-27 on Saturday.\n\nCampbell completed 28 of 38 passes for 392 yards with no interceptions, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=178098\">Dobson Collins</a> added 139 yards and two touchdowns on nine receptions for the Bulldogs (4-4, 1-1 Big South Conference).\n\nTimothy Maypray completed 2 of 4 passes for 53 yards and one touchdown, adding 130 rushing yards on 20 carries for the Keydets (3-4, 1-1).\n\nAfter a scoreless opening quarter, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233452\">Patrick Hall</a>'s 1-yard run got the Bulldogs on the board first to open the second and Josh Wine's 2-yard run for the Keydets quickly cut the Gardner-Webb lead to 7-6 midway through the quarter.\n\nCampbell got the passing game going after that, hitting Lyndrez Leslie on a 22-yard score and Collins on a 12-yard touchdown to put the Bulldogs up 24-6 at the half.\n\nMaypray pulled the Keydets within 11 points after a 46-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234706\">Michael Rainey-Wiles</a> to open the third, but Campbell's 51-yard touchdown connection with Collins put Gardner-Webb ahead 34-13 going into the final quarter.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234720\">Gabe Itoka</a>'s 30-yard touchdown run to open the fourth and Wine's second 2-yard rushing score wasn't
