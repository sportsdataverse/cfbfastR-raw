by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=505852\" target=\"_new\">Jaybo Shaw</a> to make it 14-12 at the half.\n\nGeorgia Southern (3-2, 1-1) took its only lead of the night,

finished with 116 yards on seven carries.\n\nHowever, Wofford, which rolled up 302 yards rushing, answered that burst with a time-consuming 67-yard drive that ended with Breitenstein's 5-yard
