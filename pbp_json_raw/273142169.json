(AP) -- Delaware State rallied from 18 points down in the fourth quarter, and linebacker Eric Sewell caught a 2-yard touchdown in overtime to give the Hornets a 28-21 victory over Norfolk State and the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference title.\n\nThe game ended when Akeem Green sacked Norfolk State's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=150654\">Casey Hansen</a> on fourth down in overtime, touching off a celebration for the Hornets, who won their seventh straight and secured their first outright MEAC championship since 1989.\n\nTrailing 21-3, Delaware State (9-1, 7-0) began its comeback when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=164432\">Shaheer McBride</a> hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161011\">Vashon Winton</a> for a 6-yard touchdown with 8:09 remaining.\n\nAfter a Norfolk State punt, Winton completed a 53-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173913\">Derrick McNeil</a> to set up a first-and-goal at the 2. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173905\">Adam Shrewsbury</a> plowed ahead for the score, then rushed for a two-point conversion to make it 21-18.\n\nNorfolk State had a chance to run out the clock but failed to pick up a first down, giving the Hornets the ball back with 1:54 left. Delaware State drove 46 yards to set up the tying score, Peter Gaertner's 28-yard field goal as time expired.\n\nWinton went 28-of-44 for 245 yards and two touchdowns and completed passes to 11 different receivers. He also rushed for 61 yards on 18 carries.\n\nNorfolk State (7-3, 6-2) led 14-0 at the end of the first quarter on Hansen's 5-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=163312\">Jamar Johnson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=163319\">Daryl Jones</a>' 16-yard run.
