44-40 on Saturday.\n\nVailas finished with 188 yards on 15 of 26 passing, threw touchdowns of 14, 16, and 9 yards, and added 83 yards on the ground for the Wildcats (5-2, 3-1 Colonial Athletic Association).\n\nAll three of Vailas' touchdown passes came in the first half and his 38-yard touchdown run gave the Wildcats a 34-17 lead midway through the third quarter.\n\nRichmond (4-3, 2-2) rallied, however, scoring 23 unanswered points to go ahead 40-34 with 10:21 left to play.\n\nNew Hampshire then drove to the Richmond 8 and Vailas rushed for three yards on a key fourth-and-two play to set up <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/483917/chris-setian\" target=\"_new\">Chris Setian</a>'s game-winning 5-yard touchdown.\n\nSetian, who only had five carries in the
