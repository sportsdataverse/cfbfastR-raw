Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference action.\n\nThe Wildcats (3-2, 2-0) picked off four Hampton (0-4, 0-2) passes and recovered three more forced fumbles. Of the Pirates' final 10 possessions, six ended in turnovers, and another finished with a turnover on downs.\n\nAt one point, Hampton tossed interceptions on three consecutive drives, with Bethune-Cookman using those picks to rack up 17 consecutive points and take a 31-10 lead. Among those scores was a 90-yard interception return by Addison, the fourth longest in school history and the team's first interception return for a score since 2010. On top of his two picks, Addison led the Wildcats with 11 tackles.\n\nJeremi Schwartz gained a sizable chunk of Hampton's total offense, amassing 205 yards and a touchdown on 25
