turnovers -- including three interceptions -- as the Quakers outdueled Princeton 28-21 Saturday in a battle of first-place Ivy League foes.\n\nPenn (4-4, 4-1) is still tied with next Saturday's opponent, Harvard, for first atop the Ivy League.\n\nEach of Ragone's scores catapulted the Quakers into the lead, including a game-winning, 3-yard TD run with 2:59 to play that snapped a 21-21
