offense as the Seahawks overcame preparation obstacles due to Hurricane Sandy to topple the Great Danes 30-0 for first place in the Northeast Conference.\n\nThe Seahawks (6-3, 6-1) won despite a disrupted work week due to Hurricane Sandy. The Wagner campus was evacuated Sunday, and players reconvened Tuesday to prepare for Albany (7-2, 5-1) on a campus that was still shut down and without electricity.\n\nWagner's six-game winning streak is its longest since 1988, and its longest ever in NEC play.\n\nDoscher was 10-of-15 passing for 253 yards and two TDs, including an 88-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/515679/anthony-carrington\" target=\"_new\">Anthony Carrington</a> early in the third quarter that stretched Wagner's lead to 20-0.\n\nDoscher has not thrown an interception since Wagner's season opener, and the Seahawks have not committed a turnover during their six-game winning streak."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"Sacred
