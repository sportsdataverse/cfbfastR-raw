over Nicholls State Saturday night.\n\nShaughnessy's field goals, both 42-yarders, and the defensive play of the Demons (4-4, 2-2 Southland Conference) extended Nicholls State's conference losing streak to 11 games.\n\nThe Colonels (1-6, 0-4) scored first on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/504716/marcus-washington\" target=\"_new\">Marcus Washington</a>'s 2-yard run but <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/486863/jamaal-white\" target=\"_new\">Jamaal White</a> blocked the extra-point. That ultimately cost Nicholls State, despite two first-half field goals by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/505468/andrew-dolan\" target=\"_new\">Andrew Dolan</a>.\n\nNorthwestern State, meanwhile, sandwiched early Henderson touchdown runs of 3 and 8 yards around Daniel Taylor's 55-yard scoring run for a 21-9 lead. After Dolan's first field goal, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/505481/landry-klann\" target=\"_new\">Landry Klann</a> of Nicholls State threw two touchdown passes -- a 29-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/505495/aldaro-russell\" target=\"_new\">Aldaro Russell</a> and a 9-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/480314/jesse-turner\" target=\"_new\">Jesse Turner</a> for a 26-21 Colonels' lead.
