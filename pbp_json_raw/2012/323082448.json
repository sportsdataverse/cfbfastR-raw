Taylor is tied for third most wins amongst black college coaches, with a career record of 233-96-4, and a 35-19 record at Florida A&M.\n\nTaylor led 11 teams to NCAA playoff or bowl appearances but his greatest success came at Hampton, where he compiled a 136-49-1 record, while winning eight conference titles and four black college football national championships in 1995, 2004, 2005, and
