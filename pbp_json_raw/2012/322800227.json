href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/498685/cody-taulbee\" target=\"_new\">Cody Taulbee</a> scored the first two touchdowns of his career in a 17-7 victory Saturday over winless Rhode Island.\n\nThe Bears (3-1) won for the first time in Kingston since 2004, retaining the Governor's Cup in their 97th matchup with the Rams (0-5).\n\nAfter Taulbee scored on a 6-yard rush in the first quarter, Rhode Island missed a field goal.\n\nThe Rams then fumbled at their own 22 to set up Taulbee's 10-yard score with 11:04 left in the half.\n\nWith Rhode Island threatening midway through the fourth quarter, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/483580/ross-walthall\" target=\"_new\">Ross Walthall</a> stopped Avo Isijola on fourth-and-1 at the Bears' 24.\n\n<a

first possession.\n\nChris Humm, Brown's director of athletic communications, said someone stepped on top of Theodhosi's foot and X-rays were negative.\n\n<a
