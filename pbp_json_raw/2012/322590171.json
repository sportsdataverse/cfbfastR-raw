the Lions' season opener.\n\nColumbia (1-0) needed a blocked extra point and a nullified Marist touchdown pass to survive. After Garrett's 1-yard touchdown run and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/498699/luke-eddy\" target=\"_new\">Luke Eddy</a>'s 22-yard field gave the Lions a 10-3 lead in the third quarter, Marist quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/501742/chuckie-looney\" target=\"_new\">Chuckie Looney</a> hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/512135/louis-cotrone\" target=\"_new\">Louis Cotrone</a> on a 1-yard scoring pass early in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/485994/jason-myers\" target=\"_new\">Jason Myers</a>, who opened the scoring with a first-quarter field goal, had his point-after blocked by Columbia's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/482817/wells-childress\" target=\"_new\">Wells Childress</a>.\n\nLooney, who completed 20 of 30 passes for 293 yards and a TD but threw two interceptions, then hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/486014/anthony-calcagni\" target=\"_new\">Anthony Calcagni</a> on an apparent 76-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter.
