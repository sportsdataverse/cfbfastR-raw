But the Blue Hens went on to score 16 unanswered points over the final three quarters.\n\nBaner connected from 41, 32, 21, and 20 yards, and his extra point kick following Hurley's touchdown gave Delaware a 16-3 third quarter lead. The first team All-Colonial Athletic Association selection is a perfect 40 for 40 all-time in extra point attempts and has converted 12 straight field goals dating back to last season.\n\nHurley
