sophomore quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/503697/trent-hurley\" target=\"_new\">Trent Hurley</a>, Delaware topped West Chester, 41-21, in the rivalry's 54th and final meeting. The game was the first this year for each team.\n\nHurley, a transfer from Bowling Green making his first start, was 24-of-35 passing, including a pair of first-half touchdowns. Junior <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/502525/andrew-pierce\" target=\"_new\">Andrew Pierce</a> ran 22 times for 90 yards, and became the fourth Blue Hen to surpass 3,000 yards rushing for a career. He's the first to do so as a junior.\n\nDefensively, Delaware got a forced fumble and an interception from safety <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/484537/tim-breaker\" target=\"_new\">Tim Breaker</a>, and another pick from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/502516/jake-giusti\" target=\"_new\">Jake Giusti</a>.\n\nWest Chester running back Rondell White ran for 220 yards on 28 carries in the loss.\n\nThe schools will discontinue the rivalry, which began in 1941, to face more opponents in their respective divisions.
