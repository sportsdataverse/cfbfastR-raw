intercepted Rhode Island's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/538161/bob-bentsen\" target=\"_new\">Bob Bentsen</a> on the opening drive to set up the game's first score. That set up Monangai's 1-yard scoring run to give Villanova a 7-0 lead.\n\nMonangai finished with 55 yards on 11 carries.\n\nRhode Island (0-2) answered with a 25-yard pass from Bentsen to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/483819/billy-morgan\" target=\"_new\">Billy Morgan</a> to tie the game at 7.

The Wildcats went on to outscore the Rams 24-0 in the second half.\n\nVillanova's defense dominated after halftime, allowing 23 total yards passing and 28 total yards rushing during the final two quarters."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
