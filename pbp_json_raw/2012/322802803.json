31-14 Saturday.\n\nWith Albany (5-1, 3-0) trailing by a touchdown late in the third quarter, Smith's 1-yard run up the middle tied the game at 14. Then on Bryant's next possession, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/484182/justinian-mason\" target=\"_new\">Justinian Mason</a> intercepted <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/502136/mike-westerhaus\" target=\"_new\">Mike Westerhaus</a> and returned it for 75 yards and a score to give the Great Danes a 21-14 lead.\n\nThe game never got any closer for Bryant (0-6, 0-4), who has gotten off to the worst start in school history.\n\nAlbany's stifling defense the entire second half ended any hope of a Bryant comeback. Smith's 2-yard touchdown run on Albany's first possession of the fourth quarter helped seal the victory for the Great Danes.\n\nThe Bulldogs have now lost four straight conference games after either leading or being tied in the second half."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
