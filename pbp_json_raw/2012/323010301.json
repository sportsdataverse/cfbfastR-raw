the visiting Flyers on Saturday in a 41-9 win over Dayton.\n\nSan Diego (5-3, 4-1 Pioneer League) played much like their opponents nickname, the Flyers, with Mills completing 31 of 41 passes for a school-record 511 yards and four touchdowns. Hoekstra was his favorite target, catching 11 balls for 246 yards and a score, breaking Nick Garton's record for receiving yards in a game at 234 back in 2003.\n\nDayton (4-5, 3-3) managed only 263 total yards as the Flyers offense was grounded by three turnovers, two sacks and a 2 for 12 mark on third down.\n\nThe Flyers were down only 10-3 after a 28-yard field goal by <a
