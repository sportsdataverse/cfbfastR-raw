Appalachian State's 35-27 victory Saturday night in the first regular-season meeting between the perennial Football Championship Subdivision powers.\n\nThe Grizzlies (1-1), who won their two postseason meetings with the Mountaineers (1-1), drove from their 11 to the Appalachian State 42, converting two fourth downs, before McCray's second pickoff of <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/517922/trent-mckinney\" target=\"_new\">Trent McKinney</a>.\n\nMcKinney's 87-yard pass to <a

Jackson completed 24 of 34 for 260 yards, his ninth consecutive game over 200 for Appalachian State.\n\nThe Mountaineers extended their regular-season home winning streak to 18 and gave coach Jerry Moore his 235th career victory."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
