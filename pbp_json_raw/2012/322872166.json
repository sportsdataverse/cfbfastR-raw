He also set Davidson records for career receptions (191) -- breaking the mark of 179 that stood for 42 years -- and career receiving yardage (2,362). His 246 receiving yards (including a 12-yard scoring pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/502767/jonathan-carkhuff\" target=\"_new\">Jonathan Carkhuff</a>) were two yards shy of Davidson's single-game record.\n\nYet all that, and the passing of Carkhuff (34 for 53, 404 yards, three touchdowns) couldn't prevent Davidson from falling to 0-6, 0-3. Two of Bell's three scoring passes went to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/512122/d'andre-randle\" target=\"_new\">D'Andre Randle</a>, the second a 62-yarder.
