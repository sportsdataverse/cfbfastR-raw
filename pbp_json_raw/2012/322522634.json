Tennessee State to a 38-12 non-conference victory Saturday night.\n\nThe Tigers (2-0) broke open the game in that quarter after Jackson State (0-2) had taken an early 3-0 lead. Tennessee State took the lead for good in the third quarter on a 13-play, 94-yard drive that culminated in Ward's 1-yard touchdown run.

Later in the quarter, Ward broke loose for a 37-yarder, his third touchdown and a 21-6 halftime lead.\n\nGerman later threw a 17-yard scoring pass to <a
