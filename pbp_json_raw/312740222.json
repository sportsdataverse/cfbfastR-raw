20-16 on Saturday.\n\nGrimes, who finished with 137 yards on 31 carries, scored his first touchdown on a 1-yard run to give the Tribe (3-2, 1-1) an early 7-3 lead. His second came on a 22-yard scamper that helped William & Mary take a 14-10 late in the second quarter.\n\nWhen two Mark Hamilton field goals gave Villanova (1-4, 0-2) a 16-14 lead, William & Mary relied on their own kicker to seal victory.\n\nAfter a nine-play, 53-yard William & Mary drive stalled at the Villanova 17-yard line, David Kuhn booted a 34-yard field goal to give the Tribe a 17-16 lead in the third quarter. Kuhn connected from 23 yards in the fourth quarter for the final margin\n\nThe win marked William & Mary's first win at Villanova since 2000."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
