After <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/517058/tanner-fritschle\" target=\"_new\">Tanner Fritschle</a> made the extra point, it was 28-17 Indiana State.

Bell on 25 carries.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/500445/mike-perish\" target=\"_new\">Mike Perish</a> completed 11 of 24 pass attempts for 127 yards and two touchdowns
