Saturday.\n\nBrackett completed 19 of 41 passes for 204 yards and a touchdown, and rushed for 151 yards and a score on 25 carries. His 3-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=241199\" target=\"_new\">Andrew Kennedy</a> and the rushing touchdown were part of a 17-point fourth quarter that helped the Lions rally from a 17-3 deficit. Kennedy caught five passes for 55 yards and Columbia rolled up 420 yards total offense.\n\nThe win broke a four-game losing streak for Columbia (2-7, 1-5 Ivy League) but the Lions have won three in a row over Cornell in a series that began in 1889.\n\nJeff Matthews, who scored the first touchdown of the game on a 1-yard run, was 17 of 36 for 197 yards passing for Cornell ( 2-7, 1-5), which has lost two games in a row."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
