Austin overwhelmed NAIA school Texas College on Saturday as Lumberjack quarterbacks <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233840\">Jeremy Moses</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=384895\">Dalton Williams</a> combined for 438 yards passing and eight touchdowns between them. SFA (1-1) overpowered the Steers (0-3) with four first-quarter touchdowns and didn't let up.\n\nThe score was 50-0 at the half and continued to climb.\n\nSFA racked up 603 yards of total offense and held Texas College to 92. The Lumberjacks recorded nine sacks and 14 tackles for losses and the Steers finished with minus-29 yards rushing.\n\nStephen F. Austin offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson knows how the Texas College players must feel after watching their opponent run up a school record in points scored.\n\nDawson was on the 1999 Wingate University team that was on the losing end of the old record -- a 73-11 shellacking by the Lumberjacks.\n\n\"I know exactly what that team is feeling,\" he told The Daily Sentinel newspaper in Nacodoches. \"There was really nothing they could do about it.\"\n\nSteers quarterback X'Zavier Bloodsaw completed 15 of 30 for 121 yards. And Texas College did put together an impressive drive on the first series of the game, but Cory Barlow ended the scoring chance with an interception at the 3-yard line.\n\nFour plays later, Moses found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486744\">Gralyn Crawford</a> for a 65-yard scoring strike and the rout was on.\n\n\"I'm very proud of our execution and focus,\" said SFA coach J.C. Harper. \"We've been preaching that since November. I was also happy with only having five penalties.\"\n\nMoses finished the night a perfect 12-for-12 passing for 285 yards and tied a career-high with six touchdown passes. Williams completed 6 of 7 passes for 153 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nSFA recorded 165 yards on the ground, led by Romonte Hampton, who carried the ball 10 times for 88 yards and three TDs.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=170566\">Duane Brooks</a> caught four passes for 146 yards and two scores. His 74-yard reception from Moses was a career-long for both players.\n\nIn all, seven Lumberjack receivers accounted for eight touchdown receptions."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"NCAA Division II","standings":{"entries":[]}},{"header":"NCAA Division III","standings":{"entries":[]}}],"header":"Division II/III Standings","href":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/standings/_/group/35/view/ncaa-football"}]}}
