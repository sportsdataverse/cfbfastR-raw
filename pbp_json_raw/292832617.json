Austin jumped out to 14-0 first-half lead, then held on for a 16-13 upset victory against McNeese State on Saturday.\n\nSFA (4-1, 1-0 Southland Conference) took the lead when quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233840\">Jeremy Moses</a> found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486744\">Gralyn Crawford</a> on a 19-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter, and back-up quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=384895\">Dalton Williams</a> scored on a 1-yard run in the second quarter.\n\nMoses finished 18-of-34 for 226 yards. His favorite target was <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=170566\">Duane Brooks</a>, who had nine catches for 114 yards. Williams' TD marked his only carry of the game. He didn't attempt a pass.\n\nMcNeese State's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486638\">Champlain Babin</a> scored twice for the Cowboys -- first on a 5-yard run in the third quarter, and then on a 31-yard pass from Derrik Fourroux in fourth. But the Lumberjacks blocked an extra point and the Cowboys were called for a hold in the end zone to give SFA a safety.\n\nMcNeese fell to 3-2 and 0-1."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[]}}
