way on the ground for Weber State (4-2, 2-0 Big Sky Conference) with 158 yards on 22 carries and one touchdown. He also had four catches for 54 yards and a touchdown.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159523\">Cole Bergquist</a> was 14-of-26 for 273 yards and two touchdowns for the Grizzlies (4-1, 0-1) who had their 25-game regular season winning streak come to an end.\n\nThe Wildcats, who sacked Bergquist seven times, also gave the Grizzlies their first conference loss in 17 games after Montana went 16-0 over the past two seasons.\n\nBergquist scored on a 7-yard run to give the Grizzlies a 21-10 lead with 8:43 left in the second quarter. But the Wildcats scored three straight touchdowns, including <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187105\">Mike Phillips</a>' second touchdown on the half which came on an 8-yard pass with 15 seconds left, to lead 31-21 at the break.\n\nSmith made a diving catch in the end zone on a 30-yard pass from Higgins and then <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=239005\">Brendon Doyle</a> ran 20 yards for another WSU touchdown.\n\nPhillips' first score came early in the second quarter on a 28-yard pass from Higgins, who completed 21-of-30 passes in the game.

Smith scored on a 5-yard run early in the fourth quarter following Montana's third turnover of the game to give the Wildcats a 38-21 lead.\n\nBergquist answered with a 4-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159534\">Mike Ferriter</a> to cut WSU's lead back to 10, but Higgins wasn't done.
