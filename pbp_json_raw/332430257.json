over the Virginia Military Institute on a soggy Saturday night.\n\nA threat of lightning caused play to be suspended for 70 minutes at halftime. By then, the Spiders led 21-0 on Strauss' TD completions to three different receivers. The junior quarterback finished 23-for-36 -- including a 59-yard strike to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/498578/ben-edwards\" target=\"_new\">Ben Edwards</a> -- before being spelled by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/548643/kyle-lauletta\" target=\"_new\">Kyle Lauletta</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/529920/jacobi-green\" target=\"_new\">Jacobi Green</a> rushed for a game-high 95 yards as Richmond compiled 539 yards of total offense.\n\nThe win was Richmond's eighth-straight in home openers and continues a streak of 11 in a row against VMI\n\nThe Keydettes were unable to find any spark on the damp night, converting on just one of 12 third downs. Quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/506765/eric-kordenbrock\" target=\"_new\">Eric Kordenbrock</a> passed for just 135 yards and was picked off three times. VMI was limited to 39 yards rushing."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
