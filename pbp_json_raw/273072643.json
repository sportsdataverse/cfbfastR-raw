Running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=164449\">Kevin Richardson</a> added 68 yards on 14 carries and a touchdown.\n\nThe Bulldogs (5-4, 3-3) were led by freshman quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191942\">Bart Blanchard</a>, who had 64 yards rushing, 197 yards passing with two scores -- one on the ground and one in the air.\n\nThe Mountaineers jumped out to a 10-0 lead with just under 10 minutes left in the first quarter after a Julian Rauch 39-yard field goal and Edwards' 80-yard run for a touchdown.\n\nThe Citadel took advantage of a fumble deep in Appalachian State territory to cut the lead to 10-7. But the Mountaineers reeled off three unanswered scores to go up 31-7 with 8:07 remaining in the first half.\n\nThe Citadel was able to get one more score to cut the halftime lead to 31-14.\n\nThe Bulldogs came out hot in the second half with a field goal and Blanchard's rushing score to cut the lead to 31-24 at the end of the third quarter, but that's as close as they would
