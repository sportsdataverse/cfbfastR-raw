He hit Adam Berry for a 15-yard score to cut Lehigh's lead to 25-14 by the end of the third quarter.\n\nLehigh took a 32-14 lead on a 2-yard run by Jaren Walker to start the fourth quarter, and Brannan Thomas recorded his second interception of the game.\n\nBack-up Princeton quarterback Greg Mroz's 21-yard touchdown pass to Will Thanheiser accounted for their final score.\n\nIt was the eighth win in the last nine meetings of the series for Lehigh, which won their first game over an Ivy League team under second-year coach Andy Coen.
