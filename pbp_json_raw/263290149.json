(AP) -- Montana had 514 yards in total offense\nand didn't allow McNeese State past midfield in the second half in\na 31-6 first-round playoff victory Saturday.\n\n\"It was a pretty dominating effort in all three facets,\" said\nMontana coach Bobby Hauck. \"It's probably as complete a game as\nwe've played. We've had some pretty good outings, but this was, if\nnot the best, certainly one of them.\"\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=115704\">Josh Swogger</a> passed for 259 yards and four touchdowns and Thomas\nBrooks-Fletcher had 13 carries for 113 yards for the Grizzlies.\n\n\"We came into this game thinking, hey, we're going to run this\nball, we're going to establish the run, and everything else is\ngoing to open up for you,\" Swogger said. \"Everybody did the right\nthing.\"\n\nNo. 2 Montana (11-1), which won its 11th consecutive game, is at\nhome next Saturday against No. 10 Southern Illinois (9-3), a 36-30\nwinner over Tennessee-Martin.\n\nBlake Bercegeay kicked first-half field goals of 42 and 38 yards\nfor No. 22 McNeese State (7-5).\n\nSwogger's touchdown passes were a 50-yarder to Dan Beaudin, a\n14-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=145544\">Eric Allen</a> and third-quarter scoring passes of 8 and\n11 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=145193\">Craig Chambers</a>.\n\nMcNeese State went up 3-0 on Bercegeay's 42-yard field goal with\n10:11 left in the first quarter, before Montana answered with the\n50-yard TD pass from Swogger to Beaudin.\n\nA 38-yard field goal by Bercegeay with 10:24 left in the half\npulled McNeese State within 7-6, but the Cowboys couldn't score\nagain.\n\n\"They lined up and kind of ran it right at us,\" said McNeese\ncoach Matt Viator. \"Their physical size I thought really affected\nthe game. You've just got to give them credit. They did a really\ngood job and they were certainly the better team today.\"\n\nDan Carpenter kicked a 22-yard field goal with 3:09 left in the\nhalf to give the Grizzlies a 10-6 lead.\n\nMontana got the ball back with just over a minute to play, after\nKroy Biermann sacked backup quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160142\">Mark Fontenot</a> on a\nthird-and-6 play late in the second quarter. McNeese threw an\nincomplete pass on second-and-1 and then was called for a false\nstart on third down.\n\n\"It's probably a call in the game that I wish I'd have had\nback,\" Viator said. \"It's second-and-1, and certainly we didn't\nwant to give Montana the ball back. So my thinking was we take the\nshot on second-and-1 and if we didn't get it, come back and get the\nfirst down on third down. Well, we jumped offsides and Montana\nended up getting the ball back, so I think that was a crucial time\nof the game.\"\n\nMontana ran its two-minute drill in the final 1:16, covering 67\nyards in seven plays, including the 14-yard TD pass from Swogger to\nAllen. Montana led 17-6 with 13 seconds left in the half.\n\n\"That was a pretty textbook clock drive,\" Hauck said. \"For\nsure, it was a good deal for us to go in with that touchdown going\ninto the locker room.\"\n\nSwogger had two touchdown passes to Chambers in the third\nquarter, the first one set up by a 48-yard run by Brooks-Fletcher.\n\n\"I knew that once they gave me my chance, I was just going to\nhave to show up,\" Brooks-Fletcher said. \"So I was just waiting\nfor that time and I gues they gave it to me so I tried to amke the\nmost of it.\"\n\nOn the second Swogger-to-Chambers touchdown, Chambers caught the\nball standing flat-footed in the end zone.\n\n\"Josh rolled out and the safety and cornerback went with him,\"\nChambers said. \"I was standing on the back line and I didn't\nreally do much. Josh threw the ball and that's probably the hardest\ncatch I made all year because I was so open, I didn't want to drop\nit.\"\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159520\">Ryan Bagley</a> had five catches for 59 yards while Chambers had\nfour for 43 for the Grizzlies.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173765\">Derrick Fourroux</a> completed 12-of-20 passes for 116 yards for\nMcNeese State, but fumbled three snaps in the first half.\n\n\"It was loud, very loud,\" Fourroux said of the crowd. \"As you\ncan tell, I'm a little hoarse.\"\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160163\">Steven Whitehead</a> caught six passes for 66 yards while Chris\nThomas had 10 carries for 56 yards.\n\nMcNeese State had been averaging 332 yards in total offense, but\nwas held to 224.\n\n\"I'm sure there's things that we could have done better,\"\nViator said. \"But I think Montana's got a real good football team.\nThis is a tough place to play, no question. We knew we were going\nto have to play as good as we could possibly play today, and we\ndidn't. But they had a lot to do with it, too.\""},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
