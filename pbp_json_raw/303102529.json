href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=499138\" target=\"_new\">Dillon Romain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=508983\" target=\"_new\">Drew Smith</a> rushed for two touchdowns apiece.\n\nSacred Heart (3-7, 1-6) blocked a punt for a safety with 8:58 remaining, then quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186250\" target=\"_new\">Dale Fink</a> went to work. Fink, who completed 36 of 61 passes for 414 yards, three TDs and three interceptions, threw a 21-yard TD pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=384150\" target=\"_new\">Rich Rossi</a> to close the gap to 28-23 with 6:33 to go.\n\nOn their next possession, the Pioneers converted on fourth down twice to keep the drive alive. On second-and-6 from the Albany 35, defensive tackle Trevor Anderson tipped Fink's pass and Kelly grabbed it for the clinching touchdown.\n\nThe Great Danes snapped a three-game skid against
