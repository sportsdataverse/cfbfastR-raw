href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=479670\" target=\"_new\">Calvin McCoy</a> ran for 90 yards on 21 carries as Marist beat Davidson 13-9 on Saturday.\n\nWith Marist behind 9-3 following a Toms Bernhards-Callahan 94-yard punt return for a touchdown, McCoy pounded one in from 2 yards out to give the Red Foxes a 10-9 lead. Jason Myers then kicked his second field goal of the day to extend the Marist (2-4, 1-2 Pioneer Football League) lead to 13-9 and secure the victory. The win snapped a three-game losing streak for Marist.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=502767\" target=\"_new\">Jonathan Carkhuff</a> completed 26-of-39 passes for 215 yards, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=485887\" target=\"_new\">Lanny Funsten</a> caught seven passes for 55 yards for Davidson (2-3, 0-2).\n\nThe matchup was a defensive struggle, as neither offense managed more than 300 total yards. The Marist defense played particularly well, limiting Davidson's time of possession to only 24:11, and only allowing the Wildcats to convert on 1 of 11 third down attempts."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
