Saturday as Yale routed Georgetown 47-7.\n\nThe Bulldogs (1-0) capitalized on a porous pass defense to build a 33-0 lead on they Hoyas (1-2).\n\nHart completed 14 of 18 passes for 176 yards and three touchdowns, while Fodor was 10 of 15-for 185 yards and a score.\n\nYale needed only three plays and just 81 seconds to drive 85 yards and score on its first possession, a 21-yard touchdown pass from Fodor to wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233536\">Jordan Forney</a>.\n\nUsing two quarterbacks until it settles on a starter, Yale took a 17-0 lead in the closing minutes of the first half on Hart's five-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=152780\">Shebby Swett</a>. The touchdown pass and scoring reception were both career firsts for Hart and Swett.\n\nThe Bulldogs' Steven Santoro intercepted a pass in the third quarter, setting up a 13-yard touchdown pass to Forney.\n\nTwenty-one seconds later, Adam Money intercepted a Georgetown pass and returned it 60 yards for another Yale touchdown and a 33-0 third-quarter lead.\n\nGeorgetown ended Yale's shutout bid late in the third quarter when it drove 60 yards and scored on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=385404\">James Brady</a>'s 26-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172990\">Kenny Mitchell</a>.\n\nA short Georgetown punt gave the Bulldogs good field position and set up another Yale touchdown, a 33-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=181074\">Mike McLeod</a>, who had 78 yards rushing on 22 carries.\n\nHart's 26-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233530\">Shane Bannon</a> gave the Bulldogs their 40-point lead with 4:51 to play."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
