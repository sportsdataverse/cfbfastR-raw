Kupp came in with 389 receptions, having already surpassed the FBS record of 387.\n\nEWU called a timeout after the record-setting catch to honor Kupp, who then left the game.\n\nEWU's eighth straight victory gave the Eagles (9-1, 7-0) the chance to tie North Dakota (8-0) for the Big Sky Conference title if they win their regular-season finale at Portland State on Friday.\n\nKupp came in having already broken 12 FCS, eight conference and 21 school records. He scored his first career rushing TD on a 3-yard end-around to make it 27-10 early in the second half. He added another score later in the quarter on a 76-yard punt return. He has scored in 40 of his 48 collegiate games.\n\nEWU's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4027420/antoine-custer-jr\" target=\"_new\">Antoine Custer Jr</a>. rushed for a

State (2-8, 1-6) dropped its sixth straight game."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
