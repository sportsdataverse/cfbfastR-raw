Northern Iowa has won 12 straight games dating back to last season, matching the longest winning streak in school history.\n\nThe 1960 Northern Iowa team went 9-0 in the regular season, then lost to Hillsdale in the Mineral Water Bowl.\n\nSouthern Utah (0-11) had the Panthers in a 3-3 tie after Steve Pulver kicked a 26-yard field goal late in the first quarter. But 11 penalties prevented the Thunderbirds from establishing much consistency on offense and they had no answer for Sanders' accurate passing and Gray's speed.\n\nSanders, playing less than three quarters, went 15 of 21 for 206 yards with no interceptions and touchdown throws of 24 and 12 yards to Williams.\n\nGray scored on a 24-yard end-around, caught four passes for 39 yards and returned two punts for 60 yards. Billy Hallgren added field goals of 34 and 22 yards for Northern Iowa, which scored on its first five possessions in building a 27-3 lead.\n\nNo. 2 quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172077\">Patrick Grace</a> directed two fourth-quarter scoring drives, finishing the second with a 22-yard option keeper on a fourth-and-1 play.\n\nNorthern Iowa intercepted five passes and kept Southern Utah out of the end zone until <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187053\">Johnny Sanchez</a> scored on a 2-yard run with 10:22 left."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"Sacramento
