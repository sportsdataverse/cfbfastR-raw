late in the fourth quarter and continue its dominance over Valparaiso with a 23-10 win in a Pioneer League game on Saturday.\n\nA shanked punt from the end zone gave Drake (4-4, 3-2) the ball on the 19 to set up the go-ahead touchdown -- a 3-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/554595/conley-wilkins\" target=\"_new\">Conley Wilkins</a> -- and a fumble recovery led to the clinching field goal. Another lost fumble at the 21 led to a 4-yard TD run for Wilkins, keeping Valparaiso winless in 10 trips to Des Moines.\n\nThe Bulldog defense kept the Crusaders (1-7, 1-4) bottled up except for a 73-yard touchdown pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/499672/eric-hoffman\" target=\"_new\">Eric Hoffman</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/499689/tony-taibi\" target=\"_new\">Tony Taibi</a> for a 10-7 lead early in the second half. Valparaiso was limited to 183 yards of total offense, just four on the ground.\n\nDrakes's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/516168/andy-rice\" target=\"_new\">Andy Rice</a>
