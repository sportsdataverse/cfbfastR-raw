game’s final play, to lift Butler to a 24-21 victory over Valparaiso on Saturday.\n\nThe game appeared headed for overtime after Valparaiso’s <a

a first-and-10 at their own 35-yard line. On first down, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4247130/sam-brown\" target=\"_new\">Sam Brown</a> hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3916738/stephen-dennis\" target=\"_new\">Stephen Dennis</a> for 15 yards putting the ball at midfield. On the next play, Brown ran for a 9-yard gain and the Crusaders’ <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4030136/jamari-booker\" target=\"_new\">Jamari Booker</a> was flagged for a personal foul. That set up a game-winning 43-yard attempt for Bevelhimer, who left it short but got another chance and delivered after Valparaiso (1-10, 1-6) was flagged for offsides.\n\nValpo’s <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4030133/chris-duncan\" target=\"_new\">Chris Duncan</a> hooked up with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4368499/ollie-reese\" target=\"_new\">Ollie Reese</a> twice in the second quarter, from 22 and 33 yards out. In between, Brown connected with Dennis for a 13-yard score and the Crusaders led 14-7 at halftime.\n\nBrown pulled Butler even in the third quarter when he hit Johnny O’Shea for a 5-yard score and gave the Bulldogs a 21-14 lead with 4:37 left in the game. Boxrucker’s game-tying TD run capped an 11-play, 75-yard drive.\n\nBrown completed 23 of 38 passes for 209 yards and two scores without an interception. Dennis finished with 11 catches for a season-high 143 yards.\n\nDuncan passed for 264 yards and two scores with one pick. He also ran for 102 yards on 19 carries."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
