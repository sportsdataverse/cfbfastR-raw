Liberty's lead to 28-0 with 5:41 left in the second quarter. Holloway scored again from 32-yards away on the Flames' first play of the third quarter.\n\nTaylor Brennan threw a 16-yard pass to Tommy Shaver to give the Flames a commanding 44-0 lead for Liberty (2-3).\n\nLiberty's defense played well in the rout, holding Kentucky Wesleyan (0-5) to 74 total yards and stopping the Panthers on 12 of 17 third-down conversion attempts. Liberty allowed only seven first downs to Kentucky Wesleyan, compared to 28 for the Flames.\n\nIn the win, Holloway recorded career highs for both rushing yards and rushing touchdowns in a
