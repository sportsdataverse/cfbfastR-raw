fourth-quarter points.\n\nFor Colgate (8-3, 6-0), which already clinched the Patriot League championship, McCord gained 141 yards and ran for three touchdowns. McCarney (12 of 20 passing, 212 yards) threw a 62-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/515056/ryne-morrison\" target=\"_new\">Ryne Morrison</a> to regain the lead for good, 21-16.

The PAT following McCord's last touchdown had been blocked. But Higgins' two-point conversion pass failed. Colgate recovered an onside kickoff to win its seventh straight."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
