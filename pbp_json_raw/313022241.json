Backup defensive tackle Maurice Dickson helped lead Gardner-Webb's defensive dominance with 10 tackles and 3.5 sacks.\n\nLinebacker Marty Patterson collected a career-high 20 tackles for the Runnin' Bulldogs.\n\nGardner-Webb's defensive pressure caused Charleston Southern quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/498334/richard-mounce\" target=\"_new\">Richard Mounce</a> to throw for only 169 yards, completing 14 of 39 passes.  The Runnin' Bulldogs had their own offensive struggles, totaling 237 yards -- 14 less than the Buccaneers (0-8, 0-3).\n\nBut Schley, who finished with five catches for 50 yards, tied the game at 7-7 in the second quarter on a 14-yard touchdown catch then caught the go-ahead score on a 9-yard pass early in the fourth. <a
