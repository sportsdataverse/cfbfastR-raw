Assumption Saturday at Bulldog Stadium.\n\nDepadua's 35-yard return put the first points on the scoreboard for Bryant (2-0) in the first quarter, and his 20-yard catch three minutes into the second stretched the Bulldog's lead 14-0.\n\nIn the third quarter, Bryant converted a second blocked punt into a touchdown with a 2-yard return by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/531916/chad-ward\" target=\"_new\">Chad Ward</a>.\n\nThe Bulldog's defense held Assumption to just 170 total offensive yards.  The Greyhounds struggled on third down conversions, completing 1 of 15 attempts.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/530331/james-ward\" target=\"_new\">James Ward</a> scored the only touchdown for Assumption (0-1) on a 2-yard run early in the third quarter.  Saturday's game was the first of the season for the Greyhounds, who are coming off a 3-7 season.\n\nThe Bulldog's win marks the first 2-0 start to a season since
