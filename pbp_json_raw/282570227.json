href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=189783\">R.J. Toman</a> threw five touchdown passes to lead New Hampshire to a 51-43 win over Rhode Island on Saturday.\n\nToman completed 29 of 40 passes for 309 yards for New Hampshire (2-0), which finished with 511 offensive yards. The teams combined for more than 1,000 yards of offense.\n\nThe Wildcats took a 10-0 lead on the opening play of the second quarter when Toman found tight end <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=189781\">Scott Sicko</a> alone in the end zone for an 8-yard touchdown pass.\n\nThey increased their lead to 17-0 after recovering a fumble inside their own 30-yard line. Toman completed a 20-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=175447\">Travis Negron</a> with 10:54 left in the second quarter.\n\nThe Rams (1-2) closed the gap to 17-7 midway in the second on a 1-yard burst by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186719\">Anthony Ferrer</a>.\n\nLouis Feinstein's 36-yard field goal with 5:32 remaining in the half cut the deficit to 17-10, but New Hampshire responded quickly as Toman struck for his third scoring pass, capping a six-play, 44-yard series with a 4-yard TD pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=189776\">Sean Jellison</a> before halftime.\n\nFerrer caught a 1-yard touchdown pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173367\">Derek Cassidy</a> with 2:46 left in the third to cut New Hampshire's lead to 34-30, but the Wildcats followed with a 72-yard touchdown run from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185600\">Chad Kackert</a>. Kackert rushed for 164 yards on 11 carries.\n\nCassidy completed a career-best 34 passes on 60 attempts for 436 yards in the loss."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
