The pass was tipped by players on both teams before it was picked out of the air by Venson.\n\nEarlier, Illinois State scored on a 1-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187659\">Geno Blow</a> and a 15-yard pass from Brown to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=235432\">Cody White</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233986\">Cody Kirby</a> threw a pair of touchdown passes for Missouri State (5-4, 3-3), but the Bears were unable to score in the second half.
