an embarrassing second-half meltdown as the two connected for a 38-yard touchdown pass with 17 seconds remaining to rally the Wildcats to a 36-29 Big Sky victory over Portland State on Saturday.\n\nWeber State (2-2, 2-0) cruised through the first two-plus quarters and built a 28-10 lead thanks in part to the passing of Higgins, who finished 31 of 47 for 410 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nToone caught eight passes for 135 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nThe Vikings (1-3, 0-2) began their comeback late in the third when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=235306\">Aaron Woods</a> returned a kickoff 97 yards for a score, pulling Portland State to within 28-17.
