quarter was the deciding score, lifting Villanova to a 14-3 win over Penn on Saturday night.\n\nThe Wildcats (3-0) finished with six sacks, taking the game's first lead at 7-0 in the first quarter when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234103\">Matt Szczur</a> scored on an 87-yard kickoff return. Terence Thomas led Villanova's defense with 10 tackles and two sacks.\n\nPenn's Andrew Sampson kicked a 22-yard field goal in the Quakers' first game of the season.

ground.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233353\">Keiffer Garton</a> completed 19-of-27 passes for 185 yards and threw one interception for Penn. <a
