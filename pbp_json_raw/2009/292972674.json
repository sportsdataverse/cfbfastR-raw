Valparaiso.\n\nDayton (6-1, 4-0 Pioneer League) led the entire game, scoring at least one touchdown in every quarter while holding Valparaiso (1-6, 0-4) to one TD and just two first downs overall.\n\nValentino's biggest play came in the second quarter when he ran 42 yards for the TD to bring Dayton to a 14-0 lead.\n\nValpo's only score came about two minutes later after defensive lineman Nikko Carson recovered a fumble on Dayton's 28. The next play, quarterback Nate Georgen connected with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=178833\">Nicholas Henton</a> to bring the score to 14-7.\n\nDayton, however, ran away
