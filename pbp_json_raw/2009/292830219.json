href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=483772\">Lyle Marsh</a> helped Penn to a strong second half in a 21-3 win over Bucknell on Saturday in a game dominated by defense early.\n\nThe only pass by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=385843\">Matt Hamscher</a> was a 5-yard score to Luke Deluca for the lone points in the first half and a 7-0 Penn (3-3) lead.\n\nThe offenses were stagnant in the third quarter, but in the final minute, Bucknell's Bryce Robertson picked off a pass by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=483749\">John Hurley</a> at the Penn 27-yard line. The Bison (2-2) settled for a field goal.\n\nLater, Bucknell's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=138728\">Tyler Smith</a> fumbled and it was recovered by Fred Craig. Two plays later, Blackmon ran in from four yards and made the score 14-3.
