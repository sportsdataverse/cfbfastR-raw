clinched the Flyers a share of the Pioneer Football League title.\n\nAlthough the Flyers (9-2, 7-1) will share the conference crown with Butler, only the Bulldogs will go on to play in the postseason thanks to a 31-28 win over Dayton on Nov. 7.\n\nThe Flyers have now won 10 PFL titles.\n\nDayton, which led 7-6 at halftime, extended it to 14-6 early in the third on Valentino's 50-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=476399\">Justin Watkins</a>. Valentino then scored from a yard out to make it 21-6 midway through the third.\n\nNick Glavin kicked separate 24-yard field goals at the end of the third and fourth quarters, preserving Dayton's win.\n\nValentino threw for 275 yards and rushed for 72 yards.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=379529\">Chris Debowski</a> had 259 yards, a touchdown and an interception
