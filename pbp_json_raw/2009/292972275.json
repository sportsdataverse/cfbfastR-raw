a rain-soaked field, including a school-record 54-yarder, in New Hampshire's 18-10 win over Hofstra on Saturday.\n\nManning, who also had kicks of 44 and 30 yards, broke the previous record of 53 set by Dave Taggart against Northeastern on Oct. 22, 1977.\n\nManning's first kick, the 30-yarder, was the only score of the first half as the Wildcats (6-1, 3-1 Colonial Athletic Association) had possession for 21:04. Hofstra (4-4, 2-3) fumbled twice and threw an interception in the half.\n\nOn the possession after Manning's record-setting kick, New Hampshire forced the Pride to punt, but the snap went into the end zone for a safety and a 15-7 Wildcats' lead with 8:30 left in the game.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=189783\">R.J. Toman</a> was 14 of 21 for 148 yards and a touchdown for New Hampshire.\n\nHofstra's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234261\">Cory Christopher</a> was 20 of 28 for 217 yards
