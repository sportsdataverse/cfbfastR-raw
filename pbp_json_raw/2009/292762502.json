href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=241960\">Jason Smith</a> passed for 256 yards and three touchdowns as Sacramento State rolled to a convincing 31-14 victory over Portland State on Saturday.\n\nSacramento State (1-3, 1-1 Big Sky) had lost its first three games by a combined 80 points. Portland State (1-4, 0-3) is still looking for its first win over an FCS opponent.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=379406\">Terrance Dailey</a> wound up with 111 yards on 34 carries for Sacramento State. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=484979\">John Hendershott</a> was the Hornets' top receiver with five catches for 117 yards.\n\nPortland State's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234074\">Drew Hubel</a> finished 31 of 50 for 370 yards, giving him his fourth consecutive 300-yard game. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=379190\">Lavonte Kirven</a> had a career-high 13 receptions for 188 yards.\n\nOn their first possession, the Hornets put together a 13-play drive before Smith found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190743\">Brett Willis</a> in the corner of the end zone on a fade route. The 15-yard touchdown gave the Hornets the lead for good.\n\nPortland State followed with a pair of first-half field goals by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236711\">Zach Brown</a> to cut the deficit to 7-6. But the Hornets responded by scoring the next 24 points.\n\nThe first two scores in that string came on passes from Smith to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=241272\">Dylan Lane</a>. The first, a 9-yard toss, gave Sacramento State a 14-6 lead at halftime. Lane then added a 5-yard scoring reception early in the third quarter to put his team ahead 21-6.\n\nThe lead was 28-6 after Dailey ran for a 2-yard touchdown with four minutes left in the third. A field goal by Chris Diniz pushed that lead to 31-6 midway through the final period.\n\nPortland State finally broke through again when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=484882\">Nevin Lewis</a> hauled in a 22-yard scoring pass from Hubel with 2:30 left."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
