to defeat Yale 14-12 on Saturday.\n\nThe Big Red (2-0) scored quickly on their first possession when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185652\">Ben Ganter</a> passed to Steven Liuzza in the backfield, then Liuzza connected with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185677\">Bryan Walters</a> for an 81-yard touchdown to claim a 7-0 lead.\n\nCornell's offense was limited 166 total yards, but its defense intercepted three passes, and the Big Red survived a late touchdown to win the Ivy League opener for both teams.\n\nYale (1-1) had a chance to send the game into overtime, but <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=232210\">Patrick Witt</a>'s pass fell incomplete on the 2-point conversion as time expired.\n\nTom Mante's 23-yard field goal cut the lead to 7-3 in the first. He also made a 54-yard field goal, which tied him with five other players for the longest kick made in Ivy League history."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
