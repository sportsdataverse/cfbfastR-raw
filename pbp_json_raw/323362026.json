overtime to beat Appalachian State 38-37 Saturday in the Football Championship Subdivision playoffs.\n\nBrown, who was voted 2012 Missouri Valley Football Conference Offensive Player of the Year, was 20-of-32 passing for the Redbirds, who made their first playoff appearance since 2006 and handed Appalachian State (8-4) its third-straight postseason loss.\n\nIllinois State (9-3) entered the fourth quarter with a 28-17 lead but Appalachian State outscored the Redbirds 14-3 in the quarter to send the game into overtime.\n\nAfter Brown threw his fifth touchdown of the day -- a 25-yarder to <a
