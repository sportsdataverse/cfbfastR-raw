Gardner-Webb 44-23 on Saturday to stay unbeaten on the young season, keeping the Runnin' Bulldogs winless in the process.\n\nTruss opened the scoring with a 3-yard run and, after Gardner-Webb's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/476856/kenny-little\" target=\"_new\">Kenny Little</a> answered with an 11-yard rushing TD, <a

of the way as Truss, who finished with 84 yards rushing, added another 3-yard TD on the ground to put his squad up 21-10 at halftime.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/502468/juanne-blount\" target=\"_new\">Juanne Blount</a>'s 6-yard touchdown run pulled Gardner-Webb (0-3) to within four points right after the break, but Truss returned the ensuing kick for a 97-yard score to re-establish the cushion. He added a 42-yard run late in the third quarter to put the game out of reach."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
