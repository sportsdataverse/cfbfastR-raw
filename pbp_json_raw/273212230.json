href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188852\">Marcello Trigg</a> threw two touchdown passes and ran for a third Saturday as Bucknell snapped a five-game losing streak with a 38-24 win over Fordham, the Patriot League champions.\n\nFordham lost for the first time in seven games but still claimed the league title because Colgate lost to Holy Cross earlier Saturday. As league champions, Fordham earns an automatic berth in the Championship Subdivision playoffs.\n\nTrigg connected on five of 10 passes for 214 yard and gained 18 yards rushing. A.J. Kizekai scored on an 82-yard pass from Trigg and ran for a 3-yard TD for the Bison (2-8, 1-5).\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185191\">John Skelton</a> was 34-of-50 for 366 yards and one touchdown for the Rams (8-3, 5-1). He was intercepted twice.\n\nTrigg opened the scoring with an 82-yard TD pass to Kizekai 54 seconds into the game. Following a 34-yard field goal by Adam Denko at 9:07, Fordham took a 10-7 lead on Skelton's 11-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185179\">Jason Caldwell</a> at 9:35.\n\nThe Bison moved on top for good, 21-17, at 12:02 of the third on Trigg's 52-yard pass to Rod Jackson. Bucknell increased its lead to 38-17 on a 52-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=157930\">Corin Erby</a> at 3:43 of the
