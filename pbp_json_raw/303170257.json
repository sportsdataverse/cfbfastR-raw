on Saturday.\n\nThe Spiders (6-4, 4-3 Colonial Athletic Association) trailed 6-3 at halftime before Jon Laub threw a 77-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=237956\"

managed just 274 yards of offense compared to 388 by Rhode Island, but forced seven turnovers.\n\nRhode Island lost the ball on three fumbles and four interceptions, one which led to the first score
