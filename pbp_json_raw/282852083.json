for a 78-yard TD at the 9:29 mark in the first quarter.\n\nAfter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186650\">Ryan Smith</a> tied the score on a 6-yard pass from <a

The freshman running back scored from 31 yards out to cap a 50-yard drive and Christopher's 7-yard TD run at the beginning of the second quarter extended the lead to 21-7.\n\nBucknell got within 21-14 on Trigg's 11-yard scoring run later in the second, but a 29-yard Jackolski TD and a field goal put Hofstra ahead 31-14 at the break.\n\nIn the second half, Bucknell closed the gap to 31-24 on a 29-yard field goal from Drew Orth and a 5-yard TD run from Lair. But Hofstra scored two more TDs in the fourth to put the game away.\n\nChristopher finished 14-of-22 passing for 148 yards and a TD and was intercepted once. Trigg was 11-of-16 for 119 yards, also with a TD and an interception."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
