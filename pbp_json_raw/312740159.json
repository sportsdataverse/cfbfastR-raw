href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=483777\" target=\"_new\">Billy Ragone</a> orchestrated Pennsylvania's final drive, which he finished with a 3-yard touchdown pass with 3 seconds left, leading the Quakers to a 22-20 win over Dartmouth on Saturday night.\n\nAfter Penn (1-2, 1-0 Ivy League) took over on their own 11, Ragone went 9-for-9 with 65 yards passing and rushed for 13 more on the game-winning drive. He drove Penn 89 yards on the 13-play drive, which lasted 3:40.\n\nJason Rasmussen then picked off Dartmouth's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=385905\" target=\"_new\">Conner Kempe</a> with 4 seconds left to seal Penn's 16th straight conference win. It's currently the longest conference winning streak in the Football Championship Series.\n\nRagone, whose 3-yard TD pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=240441\" target=\"_new\">Ryan Calvert</a> was his only of the game, was 15 of 25 for 160 yards.\n\nDespite Ragone's late proficiency through the air, Penn's offensive advantage throughout the game came on the ground. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=483759\" target=\"_new\">Brandon Colavita</a> finished with 102 of the Quakers' 206 rushing
