The former walk-on\nfinished with 179 yards.\n<p>\n\t   His third touchdown put the Mountaineers (14-1) ahead 21-14 at\nthe beginning of the fourth quarter. He added another for 2 yards\nwith 1:51 left that gave him the I-AA record for rushing touchdowns\nin a season with 30.\n<p>\n\t   \"Whenever I've got an opportunity to do something, I try to\ngive it all I've got,\" Richardson said. \"If I didn't get the ball\nthe whole game, I'd still be happy as long as we won that\nchampionship.\"\n<p>\n\t   Appalachian State became the first team to win consecutive\ncrowns in six years.\n<p>\n\t   The Minutemen (13-2), hoping to win their first title since\n1998, cut it to 21-17 on Chris Koepplin's 42-yard field goal with\n8:46 left.\n<p>\n\t   Appalachian State then took 6:46 off the clock as Richardson ran\n10 times in a long drive before capping it with his last touchdown.\n<p>\n\t   \"We just kept doing what we've been doing all year,\"\nRichardson said.\n<p>\n\t   UMass got the ball back, but Appalachian State's Corey Lynch had\nan interception to seal it.\n<p>\n\t   Appalachian State is the first team to take home the newly named\nNCAA Division I Football Championship. The NCAA is phasing out the\nterms Divisions I-A and I-AA that applied to football. I-A is now\nthe Football Bowl Subdivision, while I-AA is the Football\nChampionship Subdivision.\n<p>\n\t   Georgia Southern was the last team to win consecutive crowns in\n1999 and 2000.\n<p>\n\t   \"Any time you win the first one, you don't know what to\nexpect,\" Appalachian State coach Jerry Moore said. \"It wasn't\nabout the trophy. It was about beating UMass and playing at our\nvery best. The trophy is a product of playing our very best. Both\ntrophies and both championships have their place.\"\n<p>\n\t   The large contingent of Appalachian State fans, who didn't have\nto travel far from Boone, N.C., swarmed the field as the final\nseconds ticked off the clock and celebrated as fireworks went off.\n<p>\n\t   \"It was like playing at home almost,\" Moore said.\n<p>\n\t   Appalachian State was ranked fourth nationally in rush offense,\nand Richardson came into the game with 1,497 yards on the ground.\n<p>\n\t   Richardson broke the TD record of 29 set by Colgate's Jamaal\nBranch in 2003. Richardson hurt his shoulder during last week's\nsemifinal game, but he didn't appear to have any problems Friday.\n<p>\n\t   \"When I'm on the field, I'm a whole different person. I forget\nabout stuff like that,\" he said.\n<p>\n\t   The Mountaineers' freshman quarterback, Armanti Edwards managed\nthe game well and finished 12-of-19 for 146 yards. He also ran 15\ntimes for 81 yards, and Appalachian State totaled 285 yards on the\nground.\n<p>\n\t   \"It was no mystery coming in. We knew we had our hands full,\"\nUMass coach Don Brown said. \"I thought obviously Richardson is a\ngood back with great speed and is even better in person.\"\n<p>\n\t   Richardson's counterpart for UMass, Steve Baylark, tried to\ncarry the Minutemen. He ran for 133 yards on 24 carries.\n<p>\n\n\t   \"I knew I'd give it my all, and I know the team felt the same\nway,\" Baylark said. \"We definitely didn't want to change our game\nplan. We came in here expecting to run, and we did.\"\n<p>\n\t   UMass tied it at 14 in the third quarter on Liam Coen's 17-yard\npass to Brad Listorti, who tiptoed a few yards down the sideline to\nstay in bounds and score.\n<p>\n\t   The Minutemen got the ball after James Ihedigbo intercepted a\npass by Edwards at the UMass 19, stopping Appalachian State's first\nprolonged drive of the second half.\n<p>\n\t   UMass had not allowed an opponent to score in the second half\nduring the playoffs, but Appalachian State responded with a drive\nthat lasted nearly 6 minutes and was capped by Richardson's 4-yard\nrun with 13:22 remaining.\n<p>\n\t   The Minutemen then had to settle for a field goal. Appalachian\nState got the ball back and scored to put the game away.\n<p>\n\t   UMass scored on its first possession when Matt Lawrence ran\nthrough the pile a yard for a touchdown.\n<p>\n\t   Appalachian State tied it at 7 at the end of the first quarter\non Richardson's 45-yard touchdown run. He ran up the middle and\nthen veered left toward the end zone to avoid defenders.\n<p>\n\t   Richardson put the Mountaineers ahead 14-7 on his 6-yard scamper\nwith 49 seconds left before halftime.\n<p>\n\t   The drive started after a young woman wearing an Appalachian\nState jersey and holding a big yellow foam finger ran onto the\nfield during a television timeout. She was escorted away by\nsecurity.\n<p>\n\t   The attendance was announced at 22,808, a sellout and overflow\ncrowd and the largest for the I-AA title game since it moved to\nChattanooga in 1997.\n"},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"Sun Belt -
