(AP) -- Montana held Southern Illinois to 129\nyards in total offense and allowed the Salukis past midfield just\ntwice Saturday in a 20-3 NCAA Division I-AA quarterfinal victory.\n\n\"It was a pretty dominating effort by our defense, no doubt,\"\nsaid Montana coach Bobby Hauck, whose team has allowed just three\nfield goals in the playoffs.\n\nThe No. 10 Salukis (9-4) had averaged 393 yards in total offense\nand nearly 38 points per game this season.\n\n\"For us to hold them to 129 yards was spectacular,\" Hauck\nsaid.\n\nNo. 2 Montana (12-1) won its 12th consecutive game and advances\nto the I-AA semifinals for the eighth time in school history. The\nGrizzlies are 5-2 in the semifinals, including a 5-0 record in home\nsemifinal games.\n\nMontana will meet No. 3 Massachusetts (12-1), a 24-17 winner\nover No. 9 New Hampshire on Saturday.\n\nThe Grizzlies will learn Sunday if the game will be played at\n5:30 p.m. MDT on Friday or at 2 p.m. Saturday. Either way, it will\nbe just the second game played under the lights at Washington\nGrizzly Stadium.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=115704\">Josh Swogger</a> completed 17-of-24 passes for 230 yards and two\ntouchdowns to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=145193\">Craig Chambers</a> while Dan Carpenter kicked two field\ngoals and ran for a first down on a fake punt to lead the Griz\nSaturday.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=158428\">Arkee Whitlock</a>, the fourth-leading rusher in the country and a\nWalter Payton Award finalist, was held to 80 yards on 21 carries --\n60 below his season average and his second-worst rushing\nperformance this year.\n\n\"Nobody has stopped him all year, including Indiana State and\nYoungstown State,\" Hauck said of Whitlock, who was held to 66\nyards in a 27-24 loss to Western Kentucky in October. Whitlock\naveraged 193 yards and 3.5 touchdowns per game in November.\n\n\"He's as good as advertised, we were just able to contain\nhim,\" said Tyler Joyce, who had nine tackles.\n\nMontana's offense drove the field easily in the first half,\nscoring on a 43-yard field goal by Carpenter with 8:02 left in the\nfirst quarter.\n\nMontana's next drive covered 69 yards in 14 plays, capped by a\n4-yard touchdown pass from Swogger to Chambers, who caught the ball\nwhile falling in the front corner of the end zone.\n\n\"He made another great throw this week,\" said Chambers, who\ncaught two TD passes in Montana's 31-6 win over McNeese State in\nthe first round of the playoffs.\n\nThe Griz went up 13-0 on a 38-yard field goal by Carpenter with\n1:52 left in the half.\n\nSouthern Illinois didn't get a first down until the 13:17 mark\nin the second quarter and had just 27 yards in total offense at\nhalftime.\n\n\"Frankly, they had a six-play first quarter,\" Hauck said.\n\"They didn't have a chance to test us with all their formations.\"\n\nNeither team scored in the third quarter.\n\n\"They did a good job of adjusting at halftime, covering up\nlooks that were working for us,\" Chambers said.\n\nSIU got its only score on a 27-yard field goal by Craig Coffin\non a fourth-and-9 from the 10 with 10:09 remaining. It was just the\nsecond time SIU had crossed midfield.\n\n\"Fourth-and-9, your averages are not very damn good of making\nit,\" coach Jerry Kill said when asked why he didn't go for a\ntouchdown, given the situation.\n\nMontana responded with an 8-play, 79-yard drive, capped by an\n8-yard TD pass from Swogger to Chambers with 6:05 remaining.\n\n\"That last score pretty much put the nail in the coffin,\"\nChambers said.\n\nHauck said the points weren't as important as the drive.\n\n\"Getting the drive and moving the ball down the field and\nflipping the field was big,\" Hauck said.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159520\">Ryan Bagley</a> had six catches for 88 yards for Montana while Eric\nAllen had four of 70. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172467\">Thomas Brooks-Fletcher</a> rushed 25 times for\n106 yards -- the third 100-plus yard game in the past four weeks for\nthe redshirt freshman.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160935\">Nick Hill</a> completed 5-of-11 passes for 37 yards for SIU,\nincluding four to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=158435\">Alan Turner</a> for 26 yards. Patrick Jordan led the\nSIU defense with 17 tackles, including a sack.\n\nMontana's crowd reinforced the Griz defense, forcing SIU to call\na time-out during its first third down play in the first quarter.\nMike Murphy sacked Hill on the next play.\n\n\"You have a different crowd level here,\" Kill said. \"I guess\nyou'd call it education. From a coaching standpoint, it's tough.\"\n\n\"We got our butt kicked today,\" Kill said. \"We got\nout-coached. We got out-played. Montana has a good program.\"\n\nAs he left the interview room, Kill told Hauck, \"Make us look\ngood.
