(AP) -- Appalachian State won its last five games by\na combined 101 points. So when the Mountaineers entered the fourth\nquarter against Montana State only seven points ahead Saturday\nnight, coach Jerry Moore was concerned.\n\n\"That's one thing I worry about as a coach,\" Moore said.\n\"We've had some cushiony ball games in the third and fourth\nquarter and you wonder how your team will react.\"\n\nThe answer: Just fine.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=164449\">Kevin Richardson</a> rushed for 131 yards and four touchdowns and\ndefending national champion Appalachian State scored the final 14\npoints to beat Montana State 38-17 and reach the semifinals of the\nNCAA Division I-AA playoffs.\n\nQuarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190009\">Armanti Edwards</a> rushed for 105 yards and a score --\nthe second straight week he and Richardson both went over 100 yards\non the ground -- and Omarr Byrom had 3.5 sacks and a forced fumble\nas the top-seeded Mountaineers won their 12th straight game.\n\nAppalachian State, which has won 26 straight home games, had 283\nyards rushing as it advanced to play at home next week against\nYoungstown State, which defeated Illinois State 28-21 later\nSaturday night.\n\nRichardson's TD runs of 2 and 5 yards in the first quarter gave\nAppalachian State (12-1) a 14-0 lead. The Bobcats cut the deficit\nto 24-17, but Montana State then made a costly mistake on a trick\nplay.\n\nOn the first play of the fourth quarter, receiver Mike\nJefferson's pass was intercepted by Corey Lynch.\n\n\"Coach was talking a lot about how they were going to fake a\nreverse,\" Lynch said. \"I knew he was going to throw it the whole\ntime and the receiver was acting like he wasn't running so it was\nobvious.\"\n\nRichardson scored on a 1-yard run on the ensuing possession.\n\n\"I wish I could have it back, I really do,\" Jefferson said.\n\"It's part of the game. They made a great play. I should have just\ntucked it and ran.\"\n\nOn the next possession, Byrom sacked Jack Rolevich and knocked\naway the ball, which was recovered by the Mountaineers' Daniel\nOrlebar at the Montana State 3. Richardson then put it away with a\n1-yard TD run, his school-record 24th rushing touchdown of the\nseason.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187149\">Aaron Mason</a> rushed for 72 yards and two touchdowns for Montana\nState (8-5), but its offensive line struggle to protect Rolevich,\nwho was 9-of-24 for 190 yards and one interception.\n\n\"The guy I was going against was 6-6, 320 (pounds), so I\nfigured I'd just use my speed,\" Byrom said. \"I could use the up\nand under move and my speed to get around him.\"\n\nIt appeared Appalachian State was poised for a blowout win early\nwith Byrom's 2.5 first-quarter sacks and Richardson's two early\nscores.\n\nBut turnovers and penalties let Montana State back in. Edwards,\nwho passed for three touchdowns and rushed for two more in a\nfirst-round win over Coastal Carolina, threw an interception and\nlost two fumbles in the second quarter after hits from Bobby Daly.\n\nMason's 4-yard touchdown run and Jeff Hastings' 32-yard field\ngoal cut the deficit to four in the first meeting between the\nschools and Montana State's first game in a Southern Conference\nstadium since it won its last national championship in 1984.\n\nMason's 4-yard run midway through the third quarter cut\nAppalachian State's lead to 24-17, but Montana State could not\ncontain Richardson, who went over 100 yards rushing for the seventh\ntime this season.\n\n\"At the start of the fourth quarter -- down seven, wow,\"\nMontana State coach Mike Kramer said. \"That's what we wanted. We\nthought we would be OK. But we turned the ball over and of course\nthey capitalized.\"\n\nAppalachian State overcame nine penalties for 116 yards to\nbecame the first top-seed since 2002 to advance past the second\nround.\n\n\"The personal foul penalties took away from a great contest\nbetween two good schools,\" Kramer said."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
