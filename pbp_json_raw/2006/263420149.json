(AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=151208\">Steve Baylark</a> scored two touchdowns in\nthe first half and Massachusetts controlled the clock in the second\nhalf in the Minutemen's 19-17 victory over Montana on Friday night\nin the NCAA Division I-AA semifinals.\n\nBaylark ran for 169 yards, caught five passes for 76 yards and\nhad 12 carries in the fourth quarter to help keep Montana's offense\noff the field.\n\n\"They did a nice job of controlling the game,\" Montana coach\nBobby Hauck said. \"We had the ball only 9 minutes in the second\nhalf.\"\n\nThird-ranked UMass (13-1) advanced to the championship game\nagainst the winner of Saturday's semifinal between top-ranked and\ndefending national champion Appalachian State and fourth-seeded\nYoungstown State. The Minutemen take a 12-game winning streak into\nthe title game next Friday night in Chattanooga, Tenn.\n\n\"I've never experienced anything like this in my life,\" said\nUMass defensive back James Ihedigbo. \"We're going to\nChattanooga.\"\n\nNo. 2 Montana (12-2), which fell to 5-1 in home semifinal games,\nsaw its 12-game winning streak come to an end.\n\nMontana scored all 17 of its points in the second quarter -- a\n23-yard field goal by Dan Carpenter, a 58-yard interception return\nby Muckie Foreman and capped a 2-minute drill with a 1-yard TD run\nby <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=149236\">Brady Green</a> with 10 seconds left in the half.\n\nBut the Minutemen, who haven't given up a point in the second\nhalf of their three playoff games, held the Grizzlies to just 67\nyards in the final 30 minutes.\n\n\"We're not artistic,\" UMass coach Don Brown said. \"We just\nfind a way to win. Holding them to 67 yards in the second half was\nbig.\"\n\nBaylark ran for 56 yards on the opening drive, including a\n35-yard TD run with 12:10 left in the first quarter. He caught\nthree passes for 57 yards on a drive that finished with his 6-yard\nTD run as the Minutemen took a 14-10 lead with 8:33 left in the\nhalf.\n\nMontana's final drive of the half started on their own 12 with\n2:24 remaining. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=115704\">Josh Swogger</a> completed five passes for 86 yards,\nincluding a 29-yard pass play to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=145193\">Craig Chambers</a> that gave the\nGrizzlies a first-and-goal at the 1 with 19 seconds left. Two plays\nlater, Green's TD gave the Grizzlies a 17-14 lead.\n\nUMass cut it to 17-16 on a safety with 1:26 left in the third\nquarter. Montana had the ball third-and-8 on its own 10 when\nDomenique Milton forced Swogger to fumble and the ball rolled\nthrough the end zone.\n\nOn the ensuing drive, Chris Koepplin kicked a 43-yard field goal\nto give the Minutemen a 19-17 lead.\n\nSwogger's pass was intercepted on Montana's next possession and\nthe Minutemen ran 4 minutes off the clock before Kyle Ryan\nintercepted <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=157911\">Liam Coen</a>'s pass with 8:10 remaining.\n\nThe Grizzlies went four-and-out and UMass took over with 6:39\nremaining. Baylark had seven carries for 35 yards in a drive that\nended with a missed 46-yard field goal with 47 seconds left.\n\nThe Grizzlies had the ball on their own 29 with 47 seconds left,\nbut Swogger's first pass was intercepted by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=134453\">Brandon Smith</a>, sealing\nthe win.\n\n\"I thought it was going to be one of these down-to-the-wire\nscenarios,\" Brown said.\n\nHauck said even if the Grizzlies had been able to score on that\nfinal drive, \"it would have been an escape act, because they\ncontrolled the game.\"\n\nUMass had 460 yards in total offense -- more than Montana had\ngiven up in its previous two playoff games combined. The Minutemen\ncontrolled ball for two-thirds of the game.\n\n\"We couldn't get off the field there at the end when we needed\nto,\" said Montana defensive end Dustin Dlouhy.\n\nLiam Coen completed 21 of 33 passes for 234 yards while Swogger\nwas 15-of-31 for 167 yards. Both threw two interceptions.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159547\">Rob Schulte</a> caught six passes for 57 yards for the Grizzlies.\nBaylark was the leading receiver
