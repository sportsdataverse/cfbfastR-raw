touchdowns, as Villanova topped previously unbeaten Towson 45-35 in a Colonial Athletic Conference game Saturday evening.\n\nTowson (6-1, 2-1 CAA) turned the ball over on its first two possessions and Villanova (4-2, 3-0) took full advantage, scoring touchdowns on its first three drives on the short field.\n\nRobertson hit <a
