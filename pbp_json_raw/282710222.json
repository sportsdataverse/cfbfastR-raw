href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191307\">Aaron Ball</a> rushed for two touchdowns to lead Villanova to a 26-20 upset of Richmond, the top-ranked team in the Football Championship Subdivision, on Saturday.\n\nVillanova (3-1, 1-0 Colonial Athletic Association) earned its first win over a No. 1 opponent on the strength of Marcoux's leg as the senior kicked three second-half field goals, including a 48-yarder, to hold off the Spiders.\n\nMarcoux connected twice in the fourth quarter and Villanova recovered an onside kick with just over a minute left to preserve the victory.\n\nRichmond (3-2, 2-1) entered the game as the top-ranked team in The Sports Network writers' poll. Villanova had previously been 0-4 against No. 1 opponents.\n\nBall scored on runs of 3 and 63 yards and Marcoux kicked a 21-yard field goal with no time left in the first half as the Wildcats built a 17-10 halftime lead.\n\nThe Spiders got a field goal from Andrew Howard early in the third quarter but Marcoux responded with a 25-yarder later in the third.\n\nIn the fourth, Marcoux kicked two more field goals -- including the 48-yarder with 8:00 left -- to give the Wildcats a 26-13 lead. Richmond responded with a 7-yard touchdown run from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172968\">Josh Vaughan</a> with 1:13 left, but could not come up with the onside kick and Villanova ran out the clock.\n\nBall rushed for 123 yards on 18 carries to lead Villanova's ground attack. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234108\">Christopher Whitney</a> added 176 yards passing for the Wildcats.\n\nRichmond's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172969\">Eric Ward</a> was 23-for-32 for 236 yards and threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159692\">Joe Stewart</a> in the first half and Howard had a 41-yard field goal to open the scoring.\n\nThe Villanova defense sacked Ward six times and held the Spiders to 83 yards rushing on 33 carries."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
