(AP) --  <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=153054\">Jayson Foster</a> scored a pair touchdowns in the fourth quarter to help Georgia Southern rally late in a 21-17 win over The Citadel on Saturday.\n\nThe Citadel (5-3, 3-2 Southern Conference) took a 17-6 lead into the fourth. But the Eagles (6-2, 3-2) came back strong, scoring their first touchdown of the game on Foster's 15-yard run and then completed a two-point conversion on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=168785\">Raja Andrews</a>' catch.\n\nOn the Bulldogs ensuing drive, they made it into the red zone but the drive stalled and Mike Adams then missed a 29-yard field goal attempt.\n\nGeorgia Southern took advantage of the misque. Foster, who finished with 157 yards rushing, scored on an 80-yard run with 7:28 left in the game. His run tied for the sixth-longest from scrimmage in Georgia Southern history, matching an 80-yard scamper he recorded against Johnson C. Smith in 2004.\n\nFoster also completed 11-of-16 passes for 106 yards. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=166665\">Lamar Lewis</a> chipped in on the running game, gaining 82
