Stony Brook and Lafayette tied at 6-6, the Seawolves turned to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=483822\" target=\"_new\">Miguel Maysonet</a> and turned him loose. The running back erupted for four second-half touchdowns as previously winless Stony Brook (1-3) earned its first victory 37-20 on Saturday night.\n\nDespite completing just one pass in 13 attempts, the Seawolves dominated Lafayette (1-3) after halftime. Maysonet ran 35 yards for a third-quarter touchdown and a 13-6 lead that Stony Brook never relinquished. His 1-yard burst then made it 20-6.\n\nAfter Wesley Skiffington's third field goal of the game for Stony Brook, Maysonet struck again. He raced 30 yards for his third touchdown and finished the scoring with a 9-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter.\n\nLafayette's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=486353\" target=\"_new\">Andrew Shoop</a> was 32-for-56 passing for 400 yards and two touchdowns.
