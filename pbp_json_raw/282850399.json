Joe Izzo added three field goals in the loss, while <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=176875\">James Mallory</a> ran for 109 yards and a touchdown.\n\nDown 24-9 at the start of the fourth quarter, Central Connecticut scored twice to make it 24-22 with 55 seconds remaining. Wanket found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191122\">Tyler Rossnagle</a> for a 14-yard touchdown pass to give the Blue Devils a chance to knot the score at 24-all.\n\nBut the Blue Devils' try at a potential game-tying two-point conversion pass was broken up, and a subsequent onside kick attempt was unsuccessful, as was a frantic series of laterals as time expired.\n\nAlbany (3-3, 2-0) was leading 10-9 in the closing seconds of the second quarter when Tom Pandolf forced and recovered a fumble to give the Great Danes one more chance to score in the first half.\n\nEsposito and the Great Danes then marched 43 yards in 26 seconds, capped by an 11-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190087\">Jason Poore</a>,
