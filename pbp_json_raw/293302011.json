set a school record by holding Alabama State to minus-57 yards rushing in a 21-0 victory Thursday in the Turkey Day Classic.\n\nDarian Barnes had three of Tuskegee's nine sacks and the Golden Tigers (9-2) limited the Hornets (4-7) to 51 yards of total offense. Tuskegee broke the rushing defense record of minus-24 yards set in 1998 against Benedict.\n\nLast year, Alabama State beat Tuskegee 17-13 after a last-minute pass into the end zone was ruled incomplete. The Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference later said its crew did a \"distressingly poor job\" and fired the back judge who ruled the pass incomplete. The loss snapped Tuskegee's 27-game winning streak and cost the Golden Tigers a black college national championship.\n\n\"I can't blame anybody but myself because I didn't have them ready to play last year,\" Tuskegee coach Willie Slater said. \"This year, they were ready to play.\"\n\nForney opened the scoring with a 14-yard touchdown run in the first quarter and the Tigers scored twice in a 30-second span of the second quarter.\n\n\"This is my last game against Alabama State and we had to go out with a bang,\" Forney said. \"We can win every game and lose to Alabama State, and it's a losing season.\"\n\nAfter Nykeem Barton's 3-yard touchdown run made it 14-0, Alabama State fumbled the kickoff. Tuskegee recovered and stretched the lead on Joshua Harris' 17-yard scoring pass to D'Mario Franklin. Harris was 9 for 25 for 117 yards and an interception.\n\nAlabama State's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=183540\">Chris Mitchell</a> was 13 of 22 for 93 yards and two interceptions.\n\n\"Our offense sputtered all day,\" Alabama State coach Reggie Barlow said. \"They beat us to the punch the entire game. We left the defense on the field all day because we did absolutely nothing offensively.\""},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"SIAC -
