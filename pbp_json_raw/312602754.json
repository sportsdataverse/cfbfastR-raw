Valley Conference opener for both teams.\n\nHess, who has 11 touchdowns against only one interception in the first three games, threw to nine different receivers Saturday. Hess' 44-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=499172\" target=\"_new\">Andre Barboza</a> gave the Penguins (2-1) a 34-20 lead with 8:05 remaining in the third quarter.\n\nIllinois State scored a touchdown on a 7-yard pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=476691\" target=\"_new\">Matt Brown</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=384417\" target=\"_new\">Marvon Sanders</a> to cut the lead to 34-27 with 13:18 to play in the game. But the Redbirds were held to only one first down on their final four possessions.\n\nThe win gives Youngstown State an 11-10 edge in the series.\n\nBrown, who tied a career record with five touchdown passes last week,  threw for 155 yards and three touchdowns for the Redbirds (1-2)."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
