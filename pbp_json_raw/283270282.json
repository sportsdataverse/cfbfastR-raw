overtime, giving Missouri State a 27-24 victory Saturday and handing Indiana State its second straight winless season.\n\nThe Sycamores (0-12, 0-8) Missouri Valley) suffered their 26th straight loss over three seasons, despite a career-high 237 yards rushing and two touchdowns by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185846\">Darrius Gates</a>.\n\nGates' second touchdown tied the game at 14 early in the fourth quarter, then a 1-yard TD run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185784\">Ryan Roberts</a> put Indiana state ahead 21-14 with 46 seconds left. But Missouri State (4-7, 3-5) came right back and scored the tying touchdown on Kirby's 19-yard TD pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159097\">Chris Geisz</a> on the final play of regulation.\n\nIn the overtime, the Sycamores got the ball first and went ahead 24-21 on a 39-yard field goal by Baulio Martinez before Kirby's winning touchdown run.\n\nThe Bears' first two touchdowns were on runs of 16 yards by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=181277\">Miguel Warren</a> in the first quarter and 2 yards by <a
