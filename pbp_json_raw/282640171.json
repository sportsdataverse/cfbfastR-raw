href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=233657\">Xavier Martin</a> ran for four touchdowns to help Fordham rally for a 29-22 victory Saturday over Columbia.\n\nFordham (2-1) took an early 14-3 lead but Columbia (0-1) went ahead 22-14 before the Rams scored twice in the final 11 minutes.\n\nMartin scored on runs of 2 and 5 yards in the fourth quarter and finished with 160 yards.\n\nIn the first half, he scored from 26 and 4 yards out before the Lions responded with a 22-point second quarter.\n\nFordham's scoring drive to tie the game was kept alive when Columbia was penalized for too many players on the field as the Rams punted from their own 21.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=175643\">Shane Kelly</a> threw two touchdown passes for the Lions, hitting <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=241199\">Andrew Kennedy</a> for 4 yards and connecting with Austen Knowlin from 56. Drew Quinn returned an interception 22 yards and Jon Rocholl kicked a 33-yard field goal.\n\nKelly passed for 170 yards, completing 10 of 20.\n\nWhen the Lions trailed 14-3 Rocholl kept Columbia out of further trouble when he ran down a bad snap at the 10, rolled to his right and got off a punt on the run that netted 38 yards, rolling dead at the Rams 20.\n\n<a
