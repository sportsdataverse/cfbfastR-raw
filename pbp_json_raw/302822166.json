href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=188893\" target=\"_new\">Matt Kobli</a> rushed for two touchdowns as Butler beat Davidson 24-8 in a Pioneer League game on Saturday.\n\nSplitting time with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=382890\" target=\"_new\">Andrew Huck</a> at quarterback, Kobli scored on a 1-yard run in the second quarter. His 21-yard run on the opening second-half possession gave the Bulldogs (3-3, 1-2) a 24-0 lead.\n\nKobli finished with 62 yards on 10 carries and completed 4 of 6 passes for 31 yards with one interception. Huck was 14-for-20 for 139 yards, including a 4-yard TD pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=382912\" target=\"_new\">Jordan Koopman</a>.\n\nThe Wildcats (1-4, 1-2) got into Butler's territory just twice in the first 58:20. The first of those drives ended with Jack McKenna intercepting a <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=502767\" target=\"_new\">Jonathan Carkhuff</a> pass at the Butler 25. The other ended with a missed field goal attempt.\n\nDavidson scored with 56 seconds left on Carkhuff's 24-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=485887\" target=\"_new\">Lanny Funsten</a>. Carkhuff threw for 145 yards with one interception."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
