St. Francis pulled away with TD conversions off muffed punts in the second and third quarters, both capped by Drayer touchdowns.\n\nDrayer ran for a 2-yard score with 6:42 left in the first half to make it 24-14, and he tossed a 6-yard TD to Zack Drayer with 11:47 left in the third quarter to salt the game away. Both drives started within 25 yards of the Blue Devils' goal line.\n\nDolegala passed for 318 yards and two touchdowns and added a rushing TD for Central Connecticut (2-8, 1-4).\n\nSt. Francis has won
