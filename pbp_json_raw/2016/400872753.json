Towson rally for a 34-24 win over William & Mary on Saturday.\n\nTowson (3-7, 2-5 Colonial Athletic Association) ran for three TDs and a season-high 274 yards.\n\nOn the second play from scrimmage in the third quarter, Simpson took a handoff up the middle, spun out of a would-be tackle and raced 70 yards for a touchdown to trim Towson's deficit to 21-17. The Tribe responded with a nine-play, 67-yard drive that stalled at the 4, and settled for a 21-yard field goal by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/4032554/kris-hooper\"
