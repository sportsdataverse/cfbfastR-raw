ensuing possession for a 36-30 win over Albany on Saturday.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3955649/deontez-thompson\" target=\"_new\">Deontez Thompson</a> did most of the damage in overtime, rushing for 42 of his 112 yards and scoring his third touchdown on a 14-yard run to tie the game in the second OT.\n\nThompson was stopped on his PAT run after the Broadus touchdown but Albany only picked up seven yards on two runs and had two incompletions.\n\nThompson's second TD capped a long drive and put Richmond (5-1, 2-1 Colonial Athletic) up 20-13 with 2:44 to play. But <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3911912/neven-sussman\" target=\"_new\">Neven Sussman</a> hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3117839/jordan-crockett\" target=\"_new\">Jordan Crockett</a> for a 51-yard score to tie it with 1:17 to play. Albany (4-1, 1-1) got the ball back but Ethan Starks missed a 50-yard field goal wide right on the final play of regulation.\n\nBoth teams got inside the 10 in the first OT but settled for short field goals. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3911907/elijah-ibitokun-hanks\" target=\"_new\">Elijah Ibitokun-Hanks</a> had Albany's TD in the second overtime on a 1-yard
