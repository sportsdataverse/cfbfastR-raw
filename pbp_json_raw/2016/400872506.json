Word 30-10 on Saturday.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/531427/d'shaie-landor\" target=\"_new\">D'Shaie Landor</a> completed 14 of 16 passes for 153 yards and career-best three TDs for Southeastern Louisiana (5-4, 5-2 Southland Conference). Maracalin had 34 carries and Dickey had nine receptions -- both career highs.\n\nAfter a punt by Incarnate Word (1-8, 1-6), Maracalin had runs of 56, 2 and 10 yards on a three-play, 68-yard drive that gave the Lions a 7-3 lead and started a string of 23-consecutive points by Southeastern Louisiana. A 50-yard run by Maracalin late in the third quarter made it first-and-10 at the 20 and, three plays later, Landor hit Dickey for a 16-yard touchdown that made it 23-3 with 14:19 to play.\n\nOn Incarnate Word's next possession, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/548839/trent-brittain\" target=\"_new\">Trent Brittain</a>'s 10-yard TD pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/3119988/kody-edwards\" target=\"_new\">Kody Edwards</a> capped a nine-play, 90-yard drive. But a sack of Brittain and an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty stalled the Cardinals' following series and Landor hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/533454/juwaan-rogers\" target=\"_new\">Juwaan Rogers</a> for an 8-yard touchdown with 4:25 left to seal it."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"Incarnate Word","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2916/incarnate-word","id":"2916","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2916","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"10-3","displayValue":"10-3"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"7-1","displayValue":"7-1"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2916.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"SE Louisiana","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2545/se-louisiana","id":"2545","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2545","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"9-4","displayValue":"9-4"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"6-2","displayValue":"6-2"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2545.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2021-08-03T15:51Z"}]},{"team":"Nicholls","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2447/nicholls","id":"2447","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2447","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"6-5","displayValue":"6-5"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"5-3","displayValue":"5-3"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2447.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"McNeese","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2377/mcneese","id":"2377","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2377","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"4-7","displayValue":"4-7"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"3-5","displayValue":"3-5"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2377.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Northwestern State","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2466/northwestern-state","id":"2466","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2466","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"3-8","displayValue":"3-8"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"3-5","displayValue":"3-5"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2466.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]},{"team":"Houston Baptist","link":"https://www.espn.com/college-football/team/_/id/2277/houston-baptist","id":"2277","uid":"s:20~l:23~t:2277","stats":[{"id":"0","name":"overall","abbreviation":"overall","displayName":"Overall","shortDisplayName":"OVER","description":"Overall Record","type":"total","summary":"0-11","displayValue":"0-11"},{"id":"9","name":"vsConf","abbreviation":"CONF","displayName":"vs. Conference","shortDisplayName":"CONF","description":"Conference Record","type":"vsconf","summary":"0-8","displayValue":"0-8"}],"logo":[{"href":"https://a.espncdn.com/i/teamlogos/ncaa/500/2277.png","width":500,"height":500,"alt":"","rel":["full","default"],"lastUpdated":"2018-06-05T12:08Z"}]}]},"header":"2021 Southland Conference Standings"}]}}
