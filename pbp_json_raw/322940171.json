Park completed three straight passes to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/514305/ryan-mcmanus\" target=\"_new\">Ryan McManus</a>, ran for 13 yards himself, then hit McManus for a 15-yarder that put the Big Green (4-2, 2-1 Ivy League) at the 15 of the Lions (1-5, 0-3).\n\nPark's 7-yard completion to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/529826/victor-williams\" target=\"_new\">Victor Williams</a>, with roughing the passer tacked on, moved the ball to the 4 with 1:16 left. Following a Dartmouth procedure penalty, Park found <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/505418/dean-bakes\" target=\"_new\">Dean Bakes</a> for the go-ahead score.\n\nA Dartmouth celebration penalty and a kickoff out of bounds enabled Columbia to get the ball back at midfield, but <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/483617/sean-brackett\" target=\"_new\">Sean Brackett</a>'s fourth-down pass from the 40 was intercepted by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/514297/stephen-dazzo\" target=\"_new\">Stephen Dazzo</a>.\n\nColumbia, which lost 24-20 to Pennsylvania last week on a touchdown in the final minute, clinched its 16th consecutive season without a winning record.\n\nSince going 8-2 in 1996, the Lions have had losing records every season except 2006, when they were 5-5. Another loss would ensure their 38th losing season in 41 years.\n\nPark completed 20 of 28 passes for 197 yards for Dartmouth.\n\n<a
