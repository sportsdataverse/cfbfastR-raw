over Villanova Saturday.\n\nVillanova, trailing 24-14 midway through the fourth quarter, had a new set of downs at James Madison's 20, when Smith picked off the pass.\n\nThe Wildcats (4-5, 3-3 Colonial Athletic) missed another scoring opportunity early in the final quarter, driving to the JMU 29.  The Dukes defense thwarted that effort too as the Wildcats missed on a 46-yard field goal attempt.  <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/484572/stephon-robertson\" target=\"_new\">Stephon Robertson</a> led the defensive charge for JMU with a career-high 16 tackles, keeping Villanova scoreless in the second half until late in the fourth when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/513877/john-robertson\" target=\"_new\">John Robertson</a> passed to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/513902/earnest-pettway\" target=\"_new\">Earnest Pettway</a> for a score.\n\nJames Madison (6-3, 3-2) opened the scoring when Kalid Abdullah ran in from the 6.
