href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172968\">Josh Vaughan</a> rushed for a career-high 156 yards and scored two touchdowns to lead Richmond to a 30-15 victory over Massachusetts in a Colonial Athletic Association game Saturday.\n\nVaughan's final touchdown for the Spiders (5-3, 3-2 in the CAA) came with 1:22 to play. UMass (4-3, 2-2 CAA)was held to Armando Cuko 44-yard field goal in the second half.\n\nAfter the Minutemen pulled to within four points of a tie (16-12) on Cuko's first field goal in the third quarter, the Spiders widened the gap on Vaughan's 13-yard run set up by Eric McBride's blocked punt.\n\nAndrew Howard started the scoring with a 23-yard field goal. and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172969\">Eric Ward</a> clicked on a 13-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159691\">Joe Monteverde</a> to help Richmond take a 9-0 lead at the end of the first quarter. The touchdown capped a 65-yard drive in 11 plays.\n\nUMass got its first points on a 22-yard field goal by Armando Cuko early in the second quarter. But Richmond completed a 60-yard drive later in the quarter, with Ward's 2-yard keeper up the middle.\n\nUMass then moved 77 yards in 9 plays in the final minute of the half, with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=157911\">Liam Coen</a> passing to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=157912\">Victor Cruz</a> to bring the Minutemen within seven points of a tie (16-9).\n\nThe half ended with Richmond's Howard falling short on a 55-yard field goal attempt."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
