41-14 rout of Virginia Military Institute on Saturday.\n\nCitadel (5-4) deployed 11 different rushers as <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/240235/rickey-anderson\" target=\"_new\">Rickey Anderson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/499745/darien-robinson\" target=\"_new\">Darien Robinson</a>, <a

Robinson and Dupree each had two touchdowns while Anderson led all Citadel rushers with 90 yards on eight carries.\n\nThe Bulldogs' defense recorded three sacks, one interception and broke up seven passes as <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/506765/eric-kordenbrock\" target=\"_new\">Eric Kordenbrock</a> and the VMI offense struggled to move the ball through the air. Citadel held VMI to 12 first downs, compared to 21 for the Bulldogs, and only 224 yards of total offense.\n\nThe Keydets (1-8), however, had success running the ball as <a
