But the Pride was unable to complete the comeback, held scoreless in the final period.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=149527\">Matt Dicken</a> and Phil Atkinson ran for scores for Villanova, and teammate Martel Moody returned an interception 43 yards for a TD.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160474\">Bryan Savage</a> went 16-for-36 for
