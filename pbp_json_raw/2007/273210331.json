Jimerson</a>. He was sacked once and had no interceptions.\n\nEastern's defense and a muddy field combined to slow a Weber State offense that had averaged 57.7 points and more than 600 yards during its three-game win streak. The Wildcats managed 325 total yards.\n\nHiggins' 40-yard scoring pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=152399\">Tim Toone</a> had put Weber State up 16-14. Higgins was sacked three times and intercepted once.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=177143\">Trevyn Smith</a> rushed for 84 yards and a touchdown and <a
