(AP) --  Mike Buck kicked a 36-yard field goal in overtime Saturday as Colgate, riding <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172233\">Jordan Scott</a>'s 211 yards and three touchdowns, stormed back from a 28-0 deficit to beat Dartmouth 31-28.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159390\">Tom Bennewitz</a> threw for three touchdowns and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=177805\">Milan Williams</a> ran for 156 yards and another score as Dartmouth (0-1) took a four touchdown lead with 1:58 gone in the third period. But the Raiders (2-1) replied with four touchdown drives of more than 60 yards to send the game into overtime.\n\nDartmouth couldn't move the ball on its lone OT possession. But Scott moved the ball six yards in three plays and into the middle of the field, setting up Buck's winning kick, which barely cleared the goalposts.\n\nScott, who produced a Colgate-record 16th 100-yard game, became the fifth Raider back to go over 3,000 yards. Relph connected with seven receivers, throwing for 236 yards, including a 17-yard TD play with Pat Simonds.\n\nOn the opening drive of the game, Bennewitz hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=177793\">Eric Paul</a> on a 16-yard scoring play while Carro Papjohn had a 3-yard TD reception less than minutes later and Williams closed the first-half scoring with a 9-yard run with 1:17 remaining in the second quarter.
