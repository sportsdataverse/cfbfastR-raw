(AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=179915\">Monte Purvis</a> passed for a touchdown while directing two scoring drives to take Winston-Salem past Bethune-Cookman 14-9 on Saturday.\n\nThe win was Winston-Salem's first-ever against Bethune-Cookman. The win by the Rams (4-3) was also the fourth straight loss for the Wildcats (2-5).\n\nPurvis, whose TD pass was a 14-yarder to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=166654\">Bryant Bayne</a>, threw for 96 yards and ran for 72 more.\n\nAfter a scoreless first quarter, Bethune-Cookman struck first when Lucas Esquivel kicked a 47-yard field goal--the longest of his career. It came at the end of a 39-yard, 13-play drive, providing the Wildcats a 3-0 advantage at 12:45 of the second quarter.\n\nThe Rams came back on their next possession to take the lead. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172001\">Roderick Fluellen</a>'s seven-yard run with 10:55 showing finished a 42-yard, six-play drive that had been set up by David Irizarry's 50-yard kickoff return. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=192146\">Omar Kizzie</a>'s extra-point kick made it 7-3.\n\nThe Rams padded their lead midway through the third quarter. On fourth down at the Bethune-Cookman 14, Purvis threw to Bayne, giving the Rams a 14-3 edge at the 6:22 mark. That score completed an 81-yard drive that contained 11 plays.\n\nThe Wildcats narrowed the deficit with a 98-yard, 16-play drive capped by a one-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161593\">Justin Brannon</a> with 7:33 left in the game.\n\nThe Wildcats had two scoring opportunities curtailed with pass interceptions inside the Ram five-yard line. Jamaine Mack grabbed the first interception in the first quarter, and Nathaniel Biggs grabbed the second one with 1:12 left in the game."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"divisions":[{"header":"CIAA -
