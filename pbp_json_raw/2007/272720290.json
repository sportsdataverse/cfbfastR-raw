Foster is now 27-for-30 in his last two games and his perfect performance against the Catamounts was a new school single game completion record.\n\nGeorgia Southern (3-1, 1-1 Southern Conference) led 27-0 at the half, and scored on its first six possessions as it easily defeated Western Carolina (1-4, 0-1).\n\nGeorgia Southern now leads the series 16-2, and the Catamounts have not beaten the Eagles since 1994.\n\nWestern Carolina turned the ball over four times on fumbles, and Georgia Southern capitalized by scoring 23 points on short drives. On three consecutive possessions in the second quarter the Catamounts fumbled the ball away leading to two touchdowns, a 2 yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=158480\">Mike Hamilton</a> and a 3 yard score by freshman <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=238434\">Chris Teal</a>.\n\nJesse Hartley added a 27-yard field goal, one of three on the day.\n\nWestern Carolina wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=149821\">Eddie Cohen</a> caught eight passes for 212 yards and all three of his teams touchdowns covering 52, 48 and 13 yards, all from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185522\">Adam Hearns</a>, who
