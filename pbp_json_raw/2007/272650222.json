(AP) -- Villanova's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172065\">Antwon Young</a> threw four touchdown passes -- three in the second half -- and the Wildcat defense picked off seven passes in a 34-14 win over Penn on Saturday night.\n\nYoung hooked up with Phil Atkinson for three touchdowns -- including a 47-yarder in the fourth quarter -- for the Wildcats (3-1), who recovered from a 14-10 halftime deficit by picking off five passes and shutting down Penn in the second half.\n\nVillanova intercepted Penn starter <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=174254\">Robert Irvin</a> five times, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161858\">Bryan Walker</a> relieved Irvin but threw two interceptions of his own. Villanova's John Dempsey picked off two passes as the Wildcats turned six of Penn's eight turnovers into scores.\n\nYoung finished with 241 yards on 16-for-32 passing and Atkinson caught five passes for 112 yards. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=149540\">Matthew Sherry</a> added a 10-yard TD catch in the fourth for Villanova.\n\nPenn (0-2) got one touchdown pass each from Irvin and Walker in the first quarter but couldn't sustain much offense after that. The Quakers picked up just 45 yards rushing.\n\nVillanova's Joe Marcoux kicked a 21-yard field goal in the second quarter that was set up by Dempsey's first interception. Dempsey's second pick set up Atkinson's 47-yard touchdown catch from Young.\n\nThe game was Penn's first visit to Villanova since 2002. The teams had met each year since 2004 at Penn's Franklin Field, with Villanova winning three of those meetings."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
