Southern Illinois defeated Massachusetts 34-27 on Saturday.\n\nDelaware won the national title in 2003.\n\nNorthern Iowa (12-1), which had been the last unbeaten team in the playoffs, got 150 yards rushing and two touchdowns from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161330\">Corey Lewis</a> and sacked Flacco five times. But the Panthers struggled much of the time after jumping to a 10-0 lead in the first quarter and their defense couldn't make enough stops to get off the field.\n\nLewis finished with 1,513 yards rushing to break the school record of 1,383 set by Adam Benge in 2001.\n\nFlacco finished 25-of-45 with no interceptions and 7-yard touchdown passes to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=176222\">Mark Duncan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=163196\">Robbie Agnone</a>. Duncan ended up with eight catches for 112 yards.\n\nNorthern Iowa's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159218\">Eric Sanders</a> completed 26 of 38 passes for 291 yards and a touchdown. But Sanders overthrew several receivers, failed to see some open receivers and didn't look like the smooth-operating quarterback who had completed 76 percent of his passes coming in.\n\nTrailing 20-19 in the third quarter, Delaware went ahead to stay on Jon Striefsky's 47-yard field goal, the longest of his career.\n\nCuff's 15-yard touchdown run made it 29-20 and finished a drive that Flacco saved with a big third-down conversion. Facing third-and-13 at his own 25, Flacco scrambled to avoid a sack, rolled to his right and fired a pass on the run to Duncan for a 44-yard gain.\n\nFive plays later, Cuff burst up the middle and into the end zone.\n\nDefensive end Matt Marcorelle then made a huge play, stripping the ball from Sanders after the Panthers had driven to the Delaware 15 and recovering it at his own 39. Delaware converted the opportunity into a 46-yard Striefsky field goal to make it 32-20.\n\nSanders hit a leaping <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172084\">Austin Howard</a> in the far right corner of the end zone with a 4-yard pass to draw the Panthers to 32-27. But Flacco led the Blue Hens right back down the field and scored on a 1-yard sneak to secure the victory."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
