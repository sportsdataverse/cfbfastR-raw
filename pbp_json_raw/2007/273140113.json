touchdown to become the program's career passing yardage leader with 7,133 yards, eclipsing Todd Bankhead's mark of 7,018 set in the 1998 and '99 seasons.\n\nLawrence, awarded the Bill Knight Trophy as the most outstanding player in the annual rivalry, scored on a 9-yard run in the first quarter as the Minutemen (8-2, 6-1) took a 10-7 halftime lead.\n\nHe added a 5-yard scoring run early in the second half to give UMass a 17-10 lead.\n\nCoen's 21-yard pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185488\">Michael Omar</a> with 5:17 to play in the third made it 24-7.\n\nChris Koepplin kicked a career-best 51-yard field goal in the first quarter and a 29-yarder in the fourth quarter.\n\nNew Hampshire (6-4, 3-4) scored its only touchdown midway through the
