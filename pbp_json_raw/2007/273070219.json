href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=155577\">Joe Sandberg</a> scored on a 26 yard run for the game's only touchdown as Penn defeated Princeton 7-0 Saturday in the 99th meeting between the Ivy League schools.\n\nSandberg gained 158 yards on 30 carries for the Quakers (3-5, 2-3), who handed Princeton (3-5, 2-3) its first shutout since a 31-0 loss to Lehigh in 1999. It was the first shutout in the Ivy League this season.\n\nIn a defensive battle that included 21 punts, Sandberg's touchdown capped a seven-play, 60-yard drive with 12:43 left in the third quarter. Princeton's only threat of the game came early in the second period after a 66-yard pass from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162840\">Greg Mroz</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=152998\">Rob Toresco</a> set up a first down at the Penn 4-yard line.\n\nAfter two running plays failed to gain any yardage, the Quakers' Britton Ertman intercepted a pass at the goal line, stopping the Tigers.\n\nPrinceton's deepest penetration in the second half was to the Penn's 26-yard line with seven minutes left in the third
