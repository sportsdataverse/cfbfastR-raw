HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=181074\">Mike McLeod</a> broke his own school record by rushing for 276 yards and two touchdowns, including a career-long 55-yard scoring run, to lead unbeaten Yale to a 23-7 win against Lehigh on Saturday.\n\nYale improved to 5-0, its best start since the 1981 team won its first eight games.\n\nThe Bulldogs haven't finished unbeaten since the 1968 team went 8-0-1, and hasn't been perfect since the 1960 team finished 9-0.\n\nThe single-game rushing record came just two weeks after McLeod, a junior tailback, set the mark with 256 yards in a win against Holy Cross.\n\nMcLeod also moved past Rashad Bartholomew and Dick Jauron into second place on the all-time Yale rushing list with 3,048 yards. He is 326 yards shy of breaking Robert Carr's all-time mark of 3,393 yards.\n\nThe afternoon didn't start as well for McLeod, who fumbled at the Lehigh 5-yard line on the first possession of the game. It was McLeod's first fumble in 353 carries, dating back 12 games to a win at Dartmouth on Oct. 7, 2006.\n\nLehigh (3-3) gave Yale its first deficit of the season as quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161295\">Sedale Threatt</a> scored from 1-yard with 3:40 remaining in the first quarter.\n\n\"We faced some adversity today,\" Yale coach Jack Siedlecki said. \"We had to play for four quarters today, something we haven't had to do this season. This was a tough football game.\"\n\nAfter Yale's Alan Kimball made a 20-yard field goal, the Bulldogs took the lead for good when McLeod scored on a 16-yard burst around the end with 6:33 left in the half.\n\nMcLeod's 55-yard touchdown four minutes into the second half made it 17-7 before Kimball made field goals of 26 and 38 yards to close the scoring.\n\nYale rushed for 421 total yards."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"Holy
