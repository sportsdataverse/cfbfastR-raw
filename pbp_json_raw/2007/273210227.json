He finished his career with 3,806 yards rushing, breaking the mark of 3,692 set by L.J. McKanas from 1998 to '01.\n\nWith 43 career touchdowns, Murray broke the record of 42 set by Dave Klemic from 1997 to '00.\n\nThe Rams trailed 14-0 late in the first quarter before Cassidy scored on a 1-yard run with 1:04 left.\n\nAfter the Huskies (3-8, 2-6) made it 17-7 on Mat Johnson's 38-yard field goal, Cassidy threw touchdown passes of 32 yards to <a

Cassidy scored on a 2-yard run with 42 seconds to play in the third, and Ferrer scored on a 5-yard run early in the fourth.\n\nNortheastern closed out the scoring when <a
