(AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159898\">Ryan Alexander</a> threw for 381 yards and four touchdowns, and Davidson registered the school's 400th football victory in a 44-6 win over Valparaiso Saturday in the Pioneer Football League.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159949\">Ryan Hubbard</a> caught two of the scoring passes, and finished with eight catches for 189 yards to break the Davidson career receiving yardage record. His 2,230 career yards break the record held by Brett Dioguardi, who set the mark from 2003-06.\n\nHubbard caught 50 passes for 763 yards in his last five games.\n\nA 59-yard pass from Alexander to Hubbard keyed Davidson's first scoring drive, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159086\">Justin Williams</a>' 21-yard TD run helped Davidson (6-4, 4-3 PFL) take the early lead. Williams added a 3-yard run in the second quarter to expand the edge.\n\nThe Davidson defense set up the third score when Bud Crawford forced a fumble and Zach Long recovered at the Valparaiso 29. Alexander hit Williams with a 29-yard scoring pass with 5:58 left in the first half.\n\nValparaiso (5-5, 2-4 PFL), which was penalized ten times, avoided the shutout on <a
