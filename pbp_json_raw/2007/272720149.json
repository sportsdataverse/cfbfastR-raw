(AP) -- Dan Carpenter kicked four field goals Saturday and Weber State self-destructed on its final drive as Montana held on for an 18-10 win.\n\nWeber State (0-4, 0-2 Big Sky) jumped out to a 10-0 lead after a 10-yard touchdown pass from running back Adrian Conway to B.A. Harrell with 4:08 left in the first quarter, followed by a 30-yard field goal by Conor Foley just six seconds into the second quarter.\n\nThe Wildcats held top-ranked Montana (4-0, 1-0) to field goals of 47, 40 and 29 yards by Carpenter in the second and third quarters as the Grizzlies pulled to 10-9 with 5:29 left in the third.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=160079\">Greg Coleman</a>, who rushed for 39 yards, gave Montana a 15-10 lead on a 1-yard scoring run with 2:23 left in the third quarter. An interception by Kyle Ryan, returned to the Weber 25 set up the score.\n\nCarpenter missed the extra point, but added a 24-yard field goal with 6:35 remaining to put the Grizzlies up 18-10.\n\nThe teams traded punts and Weber State got the ball with 3:41 remaining. The Wildcats drove to the Montana 7, but a series of penalties -- a personal foul, holding and false start -- and a couple incomplete passes gave the Wildcats the ball third-and-40 at their own 48. Kroy Biermann sacked Cameron Higgins for a loss of 11 yards, giving Weber the ball fourth-and-51 at their own 37 for a total backward move of 56 yards.
