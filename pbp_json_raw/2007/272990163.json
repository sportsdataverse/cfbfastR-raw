(AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186629\">Jordan Culbreath</a> ran for 145 yards and two touchdowns as Princeton held on for a 34-31 win over Cornell on Friday night.\n\nThe two teams traded scores for most of the night before the Tigers (3-4, 2-2 in Ivy League) went ahead for good on Culbreath's 58-yard scoring run midway through the fourth quarter. Cornell, though, had one last chance when it took over on downs at its own 30-yard line with 2:01 left.\n\nThe Big Red (4-3, 2-2) then drove 40 yards to set up a 48-yard field goal try by Peter Zell with five seconds left to play, but Princeton called two straight timeouts and Zell's kick sailed wide right.\n\nQuarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162840\">Greg Mroz</a> led the Princeton offense, scoring on a 12-yard run and throwing a 7-yard scoring strike to Rob Tedesco. The Tigers other scores came on Culbreath's 49-yard run in the second quarter and a 22-yard scamper by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162763\">Brendan Circle</a> after Princeton ran a fake field goal just before halftime.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171396\">Nathan Ford</a> had a strong night for Cornell, completing his first 14 passes and throwing touchdown passes of 17 and 12 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171389\">Zac Canty</a>. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185646\">Randy Barbour</a> led the Big Red ground game with 88 yards on 26 carries, including a 5-yard touchdown run, while Zell kicked a 26-yard
