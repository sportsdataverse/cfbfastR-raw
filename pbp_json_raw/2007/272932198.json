Walker</a> led the Colonels with 138 rushing yards. Colonels' quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161175\">Allan Holland</a> was 13-21 for 155 yards. He set a new Eastern Kentucky single season record for most consecutive passes thrown without an interception -- a streak of 175 passes without a pick.\n\nTennessee State (3-4, 2-1 OVC) was led by tailback Javarr Williams, who ran for a touchdown in the first period and accumulated 66 yards on 12 carries.\n\nThe win ensures Eastern Kentucky of its 30th consecutive winning season.
