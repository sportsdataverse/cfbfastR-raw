(AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172968\">Josh Vaughan</a> ran for a career-high 132 yards and two touchdowns Saturday, and Richmond recorded seven sacks, three fumble recoveries and an interception in a 31-20 victory over William & Mary.\n\nThe Spiders' win, combined with Massachusetts' 27-5 victory over Hofstra, created a tie for Colonial Athletic Association's automatic bid to the Football Championship Division playoffs. Massachusetts won a coin flip for the automatic bid later Saturday.\n\nThe Spiders, (9-2, 7-1 CAA) scored first on a 16-yard Vaughan run midway through the first quarter. They extended the lead to 14-0 in the second period, when <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172949\">Justin Forte</a> blocked a punt and Patrick Weldon ran it in from the 5.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162252\">Jake Phillips</a>, who threw for 342 yards for William & Mary (4-7, 2-6), hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171118\">Drew Atchison</a> for a 4-yard score with 9:41 remaining, but Vaughan answered with a 2-yard touchdown run on the Spiders' next possession. Vaughan had 33 yards on four carries on the 58-yard drive.\n\nIn the second half, Richmond's Andrew Howard hit a 28-yard field goal with 12:48 remaining in the third quarter. The Tribe's Phillips scored from the 1 on the ensuing series, cutting the margin to 24-13 with 10:37 left.\n\nA 5-yard scoring run by Richmond quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172969\">Eric Ward</a> and a 5-yard touchdown on an end-around by the Tribe's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162246\">Elliott Mack</a> completed the scoring.\n\nMack had a career-high 10 catches for 201 yards for the Tribe."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
