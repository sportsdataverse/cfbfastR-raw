(AP) --  After a poor start, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=163047\">Mark Cunningham</a> helped Austin Peay to a 17-14 win over Tennessee-Martin with two TDs in the third quarter.\n\nCunningham found wide receiver <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=234416\">Adrian Mines</a> from 21-yards out for a score before diving for another touchdown on a sneak at the goal line.\n\nIt was the first conference victory for Austin Peay (3-1, 1-1 Ohio Valley Conference) over defending OVC Champion Tennessee-Martin (0-4, 0-1 OVC).\n\nMartin trampled the Govs' defense on their first possession, marching 87 yards on 10 plays to score on a three-yard pass to Linzy Patterson from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=187075\">Dexter Anoka</a>. A mere six minutes later, Anoka hit <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=175718\">Roren Thomas</a> from nine yards out, extending the Skyhawks' lead to 14.\n\nAustin Peay turned the ball over on downs twice and missed a 20-yard field goal before finally getting on the scoreboard with a 43-yard field goal by Isaac Ziolkowski, the team's only points before the half.\n\nBut the third quarter marked a comeback for Austin Peay. With their offense surging with two minutes remaining in the ballgame, Martin's fate was sealed when Dexter Anoka's pass was tipped and intercepted by Govs' cornerback Kelvin Young."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full Standings","href":"http://www.espn.com/college-football/standings"},"groups":[{"standings":{"entries":[{"team":"UT
