safety with five minutes to play, completed the scoring for the Big Red (5-5, 2-5), which lost its seventh straight Ivy League road game.\n\nPenn dominated throughout, including two touchdowns within 1:37. Leading 17-0, Walker connected with Lepisto on a 53-yard scoring play with 42 seconds left in the second quarter. At the 14:05 mark of the third, a blocked punt by linebacker Glen Pressman led to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=183177\">Chris Ashley</a>'s 22-yard touchdown.\n\nWalker finished 7-for-11 passing for 118 yards and rushed for 95 yards on 16 carries for the Quakers.\n\nIt was the 114th meeting between the schools.
