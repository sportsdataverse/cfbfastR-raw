(AP) -- Cody Elder kicked a 20-yard field goal with 1:24 remaining to break a tie, and Davidson's special teams tied an NCAA single-game record with three safeties in a 24-21 victory over Drake Saturday night.\n\nElder's kick capped an 11-play, 62-yard drive for the Wildcats (4-3, 2-2 Pioneer Football League).\n\nAll three safeties resulted from attempted punts by Drake's Brandon Wubs. Each time, long-snapper <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185721\">Travis Klatt</a> sailed the ball over Wubs' head. The first of the three safeties came with Wubs attempting to punt from his own 33, and the second after Wubs trying to kick from his own 47.\n\nDavidson also blocked a punt to set up <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186604\">Kirk Benedict</a>'s 2-yard run with 7:50 left. The Wildcats missed the 2-point conversion try, but led 21-13.\n\nAlabama State had three safeties against Albany St. on Oct. 15, 1988, the only other time in Football Championship Subdivision history that a team has scored three safeties in one game. Four Football Bowl Subdivision teams have recorded three safeties, with the last by Bowling Green against Miami University on Nov. 15, 2005.\n\nDrake (5-3, 2-2 Pioneer) tied the score on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=158631\">Scott Phaydavong</a>'s 17-yard run with 5:14 to go and added a 2-point conversion pass.\n\nThe Bulldogs took the ensuing kickoff to their own 46, but <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=158660\">Derek Retherford</a>'s first-and-10 pass from his own 46 was intercepted by Matt Mikrut to secure the win."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
