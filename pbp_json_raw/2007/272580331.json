(AP) -- <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171156\">Matt Nichols</a> threw for 252 yards and two touchdowns as Eastern Washington beat UC Davis 41-31 in a non-conference game Saturday that saw the teams roll up nearly 1,000 yards of offense.\n\nNichols completed 25 of 42 passes and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173583\">Dale Morris</a> had three rushing touchdowns to help the Eagles (2-0) outlast the Aggies (1-2). The teams combined for 995 yards -- including 517 by UC Davis -- and 102 pass attempts.\n\nWith EWU ahead 34-24 midway through the fourth quarter and UC Davis driving, the Eagles' Lonnie Hosley intercepted a <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159314\">Tim Plough</a> pass at the goal line.\n\nThe next two plays -- runs of 50 yards by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=169082\">Alexis Alexander</a> and 33 yards by Morris -- pushed the ball deep into UC Davis territory before Morris carried it in from the 3-yard line to give the Eagles a 41-24 advantage.\n\nNichols' 32-yard scoring strike to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171141\">Brynsen Brown</a> had given Eastern a 27-17 lead with 4:23 left in the third quarter. The Aggies answered on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159321\">Kale Turner</a>'s 25-yard TD reception from Plough to pull within 27-24 early in the fourth.\n\nNichols' 6-yard scoring toss <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=148939\">Tom McAndrews</a> then pushed the EWU lead to 34-24 with 9:57 left in the game.\n\nTurner, who had eight catches for 107 yards, also had an 88-yard scoring run in the first half.\n\nPlough finished 38 of 58 for 388 yards, with two TDs and two interceptions.\n\nFor Eastern, Alexander finished with 122 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries, and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171140\">Aaron Boyce</a> had nine catches for 107 yards, all in the first
