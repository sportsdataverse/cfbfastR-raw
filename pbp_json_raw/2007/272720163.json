(AP) -- Princeton football opened its defense of its Ivy League title with a 42-32, turnover-filled win over Columbia at home on Saturday.\n\nThe Tigers (2-1, 1-0) survived four turnovers of their own by forcing Columbia to commit three for their fourth straight win over the Lions (1-2, 0-1).\n\nOtherwise, the top two defenses in the Ivy League had difficulty stopping each other as they combined for 965 yards of total offense.\n\nKevin Kelleher's second interception of the day with 4:44 remaining, and the Tigers leading 35-32, dashed Columbia's chances.\n\nPrinceton sealed the win with a 57-yard drive culminating in quarterback Bill Foran's second rushing touchdown of the game.\n\nEarlier, R.C. Lagomarsino scored the go-ahead touchdown on an 8-yard run 1:18 into the fourth quarter. Princeton built the lead to 35-24 less than three minutes later on Greg Mroz's 1-yard touchdown pass to Jake Staser.\n\nColumbia drove 68 yards for a touchdown from <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159609\">Craig Hormann</a> to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159632\">Jamal Russell</a> on the next possession. A two-point conversion pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159633\">Tim Paulin</a> brought the Lions within a field goal with 7:25 left.\n\nEarlier, Princeton built a 21-3 lead on Foran's first touchdown run, a 32-yard run by Rob Toresco and 1-yard plunge by Lagomarsino."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
