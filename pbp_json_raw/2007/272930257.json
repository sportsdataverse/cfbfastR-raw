(AP) -- Richmond's defense had six sacks and blocked a punt for a touchdown Saturday as the No. 18 Spiders beat Rhode Island 38-6 in Colonial Athletic Association football.\n\nSpiders quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172969\">Eric Ward</a> connected on 11-of-20 passes for 131 yards and a touchdown and rushed for 74 yards including a career-high 40-yard run in the second quarter.\n\nRichmond (5-2, 3-1) scored on its first two possessions of the game. Andrew Howard connected on a 33-yard field goal with 10:48 remaining and Ward connected with <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159679\">Tim Hightower</a> for a 12-yard score with 4:56 remaining.\n\nThe Spiders scored on their first possession of the second half on a 30-yard run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172968\">Josh Vaughan</a>.\n\nRichmond had three fourth-quarter touchdowns, two in a span of 1:13. Ward had a one-yard run with 7:47 left. On the Rams next possession, <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186738\">Shawn Leonard</a>'s punt was blocked by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172949\">Justin Forte</a>.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=191624\">Jonathan Mayfield</a> picked up the ball and ran for a 24-yard touchdown. Forte capped the fourth quarter with a 14-yard score with 3:30 remaining.\n\nAlthough the Rams ran 16 more plays than Richmond, Rhode Island (1-6, 0-4) managed only a pair of field goals by Bryan Giannecchini. Rams quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173367\">Derek Cassidy</a> was 8-of-16 but was sacked six times and tackled for five other losses.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=173366\">Joe Casey</a> led the Rams with 94 yards rushing.\n\nHightower's 96 yards on the ground led Richmond, and Vaughan contributed 71.\n\nEric McBride led the Spiders with 16 tackles, one sack and two tackles for losses."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
