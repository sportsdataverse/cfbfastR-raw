href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162745\">Liam O'Hagan</a> threw a pair of touchdown passes and ran for a third Saturday to help Harvard defeat Brown 24-17 in the first night game ever played in the 104-year history of Harvard Stadium.\n\nO'Hagan gave the Crimson (1-1, 1-0 Ivy League) a 21-17 lead at halftime when he scored on a one yard dive off tackle with 58 seconds left in the second quarter. The touchdown was set up when Andrew Berry returned a Brown kickoff 40 yards.\n\nThe Crimson starting quarterback completed 19 of his 29 passes for 200 yards and ran for an additional 58 yards. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162747\">Chris Pizzotti</a> was 10 of 16 for 101 yards.\n\nMichael Daugherty completed 18 of his 44 passes for Brown (1-1, 0-1), but he threw three interceptions in the fourth quarter and the Bears missed a field goal in the final quarter.\n\nPatrick Long's 23-yard field goal with 3:07 left in the game was the only scoring in the second half and gave the Crimson a 24-17 lead. The scoring drive of 70 yards was directed by Pizzotti, who replaced O'Hagan midway through the third quarter after suffering a suspected concussion.\n\nSteve Morgan kicked a 23-yard field goal for Brown, his 40th field goals of his career that placed him second all-time in the Ivy League.\n\nHe also kicked two extra points giving him a total of 221 career kicking points which also puts him in second place in the Ivy League record books.\n\nBrown's <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186079\">Buddy Farnham</a> caught eight passes for 102 yards.\n\nThe historic night game at the nation's oldest college football stadium marks the 107th Harvard-Brown meeting in a rivalry that dates to 1893. The reinforced concrete horseshoe has seen leather helmets come and go, inspired the forward pass and witnessed countless M.I.T. pranks.\n\nIn 1906, when reformists led by President Theodore Roosevelt went looking for ways to soften what had become a brutal game, they considered widening the field by 40 yards to open up the game. But they couldn't, because the Harvard stands were set in place.\n\nSo they approved the forward pass instead.\n\nThe lights are part of a stadium renovation that started when FieldTurf replaced the grass before last season; an inflatable bubble goes up in the winter, allowing teams to practice during the offseason."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
