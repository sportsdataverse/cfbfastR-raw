The Colonels went undefeated at home (5-0) for the first time since 1995 and compiled an unbeaten record against conference foes.\n\nDunn and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=161912\">Bobby Washington</a> combined for 108 yards rushing in the first half. Dunn also scored two touchdowns.

Shipp scored two touchdowns.\n\nShipp hauled in a 37-yard pass in the third quarter on fourth-and-10 that set up a 2-yard run by Barnes to make the score 28-17 with 3:44 left in the
