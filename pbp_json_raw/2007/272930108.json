meeting between the teams on Saturday.\n\nHarvard (4-2, 3-0 Ivy) scored on its first two possessions -- a 41-yard touchdown reception by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=152733\">Corey Mazza</a> and a 23-yard field goal by Patrick Long.\n\nBut the Tigers (2-4, 1-2) tied it on Connor Louden's 34-yard field goal early in the second quarter and a 29-yard touchdown run by <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172397\">R.C. Lagomarsino</a>.\n\nLong's 28-yard field goal with just over a minute to play in the first half gave the Crimson a 13-10 halftime lead.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185697\">Cheng Ho</a>, who rushed for 113 yards, scored on a 1-yard run on Harvard's first possession of the second half. Ho also had three catches for 61 yards.\n\nPizzotti threw a 20-yard touchdown strike to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185692\">Mike Cook</a> with less than five minutes to play.\n\nPrinceton used three quarterbacks. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=146186\">Bill Foran</a> went 3-for-8 before leaving in the second half with a concussion. <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=162840\">Greg Mroz</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=172384\">Brian Anderson</a> each threw an interception, both to Crimson cornerback Steven Williams.\n\nMazza had 71 yards receiving while Crimson tight end <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=185739\">Jason Miller</a> had 84 yards on three
