href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=181074\">Mike McLeod</a> scored three second-half touchdowns to keep Yale undefeated with a 28-7 victory over Columbia on Saturday.\n\nMcLeod finished with 133 yards rushing on 35 carries, scoring on runs of 8 and 15 yards in the third quarter and another of 8 yards in the fourth quarter after a scoreless first half.\n\nYale (7-0, 4-0 Ivy League) won its eighth game in a row, and sixth straight over Columbia. The Lions (1-6, 0-4) lost five straight.\n\nSophomore <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=151009\">Jordan Farrell</a> added the final touchdown on an 8-yard run midway through the fourth quarter.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=159609\">Craig Hormann</a> threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190756\">Austin Knowlin</a> with 3:46 left for the Lions' only score.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=163270\">Matt Polhemus</a> was 9-for-21 passing for 139 yards for the Bulldogs, while Hormann completed 17 of 30 for 153 yards for the Lions.\n\nA heavy rain marred the first half during which the teams traded eight turnovers, including five fumbles. Each added a turnover in the second half, boosting the game total to 10.\n\nColumbia had the only scoring opportunity in the opening half but Jon Rocholl's 39-yard field goal attempt with 5:52 remaining in the second quarter was wide left.\n\nYale had a 437-218 edge in total offense including 298-65 on the ground."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
