(AP) --  Matthew Parker scored a 61-yard touchdown off an interception in the fourth quarter to help push St. Francis to a 35-30 win over Sacred Heart on Saturday.\n\nSacred Heart (3-6, 0-4) gave up 173 yards in penalties against the Red Flash, which had been winless in six games before Saturday.\n\nSacred Heart's 460 total yards of offense far outpaced the 248 by St. Francis, but costly mistakes left the Pioneers in last place in the Northeast conference standings.\n\nSt. Francis (1-6, 1-3) received two touchdowns from quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186839\">George Little</a> and a rushing touchdown from Cal Williams with 11:30 left in the game to get a 28-10 lead. Williams netted 79 yards on the ground.\n\nDespite losing two fumbles on punt returns, Steve Tedesco paced the Pioneers' offense with nine catches, three touchdowns, and 184 receiving yards.\n\nRedshirt freshman quarterback <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186250\">Dale Fink</a> contributed 289 yards on 25-for-47 passing, with all of his scoring strikes going to Tedesco.\n\nSenior running back <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=164148\">Jason Payne</a> ran for a 75-yard touchdown with 4:00 remaining in the fourth to cut Sacred Heart's deficit to 35-30.\n\nHowever, the Red Flash converted on a fake punt on fourth-and-two at the Sacred Heart 19-yard line with just under two minutes left, by handing off to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=240835\">Tyler Gillmen</a>, who ran for 28 more yards."},"videos":[],"standings":{"fullViewLink":{"text":"Full
