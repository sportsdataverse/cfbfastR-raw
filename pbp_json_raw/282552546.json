Redhawks tied it 17-17 with 18 seconds remaining in the half on an eight-play drive capped by Harris' 1-yard scoring run. But Kraemer's 51-yard field goal with 4 seconds left put the Golden Eagles up 20-17 at halftime.\n\nSoutheast Missouri went ahead 27-23 on Lillard's 21-yard touchdown pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=236475\">Bradley Brown</a> early in the fourth quarter.
