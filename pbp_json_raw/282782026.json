against 363 for the Bulldogs (3-2, 1-1) in the first half.\n\nEdwards completed touchdown passes of 25 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190007\">Matt Cline</a>, 4 yards to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190019\">CoCo Hillary</a> and 68 yards to Radford in the second quarter, and tacked on a 24-yard scoring pass to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190022\">Josh Johnson</a> in the fourth quarter. He also had touchdown runs of 16 and 3 yards in the second quarter.\n\nEdwards was 14 of 18 passing for 225 yards and ran for 80 yards, pushing his career totals to 4,986 yards passing and 3,066 yards rushing to become the 12th player in Division I history to gain more than 3,000 career passing yards and 3,000 career rushing yards.\n\nRadford put the Mountaineers ahead with his 29-yard touchdown run with 5:26 left in the first quarter, and pushed that lead to 20-0 early in the second quarter on Cline's touchdown reception and Edwards' 16-yard run.\n\nThe Citadel broke the shutout midway through the second quarter on Ryan Edwards' 3-yard run with 6:55 remaining, but Appalachian State scored three times, on Hillary and Radford's TD catches and Armanti Edwards' 3-yard run, to make it 41-7 at the half.\n\nThe Citadel scored twice in the second half, on <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=186392\">Andre Roberts</a>' 50-yard punt return in the third and <a
