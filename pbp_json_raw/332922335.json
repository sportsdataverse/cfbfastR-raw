come-from-behind 55-52 victory over Liberty Saturday night.\n\nThe teams traded rushing touchdowns in the first overtime before Catron's winning kick.  Coastal Carolina (7-0, 2-0 Big South) blocked a 40-yard field goal attempt to seal the win.  The Chanticleers, who were one of five remaining unbeaten FCS teams going into the week, have won 13 of the previous 14 games dating back to last season.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/529583/lorenzo-taliaferro\" target=\"_new\">Lorenzo Taliaferro</a> and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/514045/alex-ross\" target=\"_new\">Alex Ross</a> accounted for seven touchdowns to lead the Chanticleers.\n\nLiberty (3-4, 0-1) led by as much as 19 points early in the third quarter before the Chanticleers roared back to tie the game at 45 with 46 seconds remaining.  Ross passed to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/college-football/player/_/id/514044/thomas-pauciello\" target=\"_new\">Thomas Pauciello</a> for a 15-yard touchdown, and then connected with <a
