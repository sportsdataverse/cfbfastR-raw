Nichols passed to <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=190472\">Evan Robbins</a> for 36 yards to the Vikings' 42 with seven seconds to go, but Nichols' final pass attempt was intercepted in the end zone as time expired.\n\nPortland State overcame 13 penalties and two first-half turnovers -- an interception by Terry Mixon that led to Eastern Washington's second touchdown and a fumble at the Eastern Washington 1 in the final minute of the second quarter.\n\nFor the Vikings, Joseph finished with 10 catches for 120 yards and White completed 29-of-47 passes.\n\nThe Vikings entered the game with just 87 yards rushing in four games, but they had 98 in the first half alone and finished with 191.\n\nNichols was 19-of-30 for 363 yards passing for the Eagles, who were held to 54 yards rushing on 39 attempts.\n\nBoyce had six catches for 119 yards and <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=171141\">Brynsen Brown</a> had five catches for 139 yards
